{"dataman_score": 3.0, "text": "Please visit the new home of Majikthise at\n\n\u00ab Beyerstein photo makes TIME magazine! | Main | Official statement from Edwards: Amanda and Shakes not fired! \u00bb\n\nFebruary 08, 2007\n\nWho is Amanda-basher Bill Donohue?\n\nCatholic League president Bill Donohue has been one of the leading detractors of Edwards bloggers Amanda Marcotte and Melissa McEwan. He has been widely quoted in the established media calling Marcotte and McEwan \"anti-Catholic, vulgar, trash-talking bigots.\"\n\nWho is Bill Donohue? And why do the New York Times and the AP print his deranged ramblings as if they were the pronouncements of a serious civil rights leader?\n\nThis is a guy who complained on national TV that gays haven't apologized to straights for AIDS (video):\n\nDONOHUE: The fact of the matter is it's due to the behavioral recklessness of gay men in New York City, that they're endangering the lives of everybody. So, you want to talk about the Catholic Church intervening in other people's lives? The gay community has yet to apologize to straight people for all the damage that they have done -- for contaminating the blood supply in New York City and around the country. And I find it amazing that, when people are acting so morally delinquent, that they're asking for more rights at the same time.\n\nIt seems to me that gay people in this country should apologize to the rest of the people, the way the pope has apologized to other people, and practice sexual reticence. Practice restraint, and you won't have the problem. It's entirely a result of behavioral recklessness that we have this disease [HIV/AIDS]. And it's a politically correct disease, isn't it? [MM]\n\nMedia Matters has been tracking this fringe figure for years:\n\nHe has referred to the \"gay death style,\" remarked, \"God forbid we'd run out of little gay kids,\" claimed that Senator John Kerry \"never found an abortion he couldn't justify,\" and claimed that \"Hollywood is controlled by secular Jews who hate Christianity in general and Catholicism in particular ... Hollywood likes anal sex.\" [MM]\n\nDonohue uses the word \"bigot\" a lot. The top headline on the Catholic League's website today? BARBARA WALTERS\u2014HOUSE MOM TO BIGOTS (for working with Rosie O'Donnell).\n\nHere are a few other gems from the Catholic League's press release vault:\n\nAmerican Prospect Censors Its Own Writer (TAP declined to give the Catholic League permission to reprint a TAP article).\n\nUniversity of Minnesota Funds Bigotry.\n\nDemocratic Religious Guru Cracks Up; Howard Dean is in a Jam (accuses Rabbi Michael Lerner of insanity for his views on the family).\n\nIs Rolling Stone Racist? (\u201cIf it is true that [hip hop artist Kanye] West is a morally confused black young man, it is also true that Rolling Stone is staffed by morally challenged white veterans: they are to West what white boxing agents in the 20th century were to black boxers\u2014rip-off artists.\" [...]).\n\nLos Angeles Times Writer Spews Hate (re: Robert Scheer).\n\nKatrina Brings Out the Devil in Them (about how rival Protestant fundies, Planed Parenthood, condom distributing university administrators should be locked up).\n\nHoward Dean Hijacks Christianity.\n\nAnti-Catholic Bigotry Explodes at the Village Voice.\n\nHere's Bill Donahue on the Jews of Hollywood.\n\nHere's Bill Donohue trashing a show he admits he hasn't seen.\n\nWho else has Donohue branded as anti-Catholic? An severely abbreviated list: CNN's Jack Cafferty, the Colorado legislature, the religious left, The Smithsonian, A&E, CSI....\n\nCoturnix has the latest on the ongoing right-wing smear campaign against the Edwards bloggers.\n\n\nTrackBack URL for this entry:\n\nListed below are links to weblogs that reference Who is Amanda-basher Bill Donohue?:\n\n\u00bb Update on Marcotte and McEwan from I'm sick of your insane demands.\nJohn Edwards has released a statement saying that although he was \"personally offended\" by some of the things Amanda Marcotte (of Pandagon) and Melissa McEwan (of Shakespeare's Sister) said on their blogs, he has decided to give them a \"fair... [Read More]\n\n\nBill Donohue is a hysterical, psycho, bigoted, misogynistic, fear-mongering, repressed, self-loathing SOB. And those are his good qualities. There is not a truly Christian bone in his body. I'm embarrased that the MSM keeps giving him airtime. For a supposed straight Catholic guy, his preoccupation with anal sex speaks volumes.\n\nI'd like to know exactly who keeps booking him for these TV appearances. Those bookers are in serious need of an e-mail campaign educating them about the real Bill Donohue.\n\n\n\nBut he's got \"zazz\"!\n\nI first encountered Donohue a good 20 years ago, shortly after first moving to NYC. He wanted Mayor Koch to reroute the Gay Pride March off of 5th Ave so it wouldn't go past St. Pat's. Allowing gays march past a Catholic Church, he maintained with an utterly straight face, was tantamount to allowing Nazis to parade past a synagogue.\n\nAnd 20 years on, he's still going strong, the Energizer Bunny of ultra-rightwing Catholic nutjobs.\n\nAs I have said from time to time, if an actor in a movie playing a Catholic character or a performance artist posing as a Catholic said the things that Donohue does as part of their role, he would be roundly condemned by Catholics as being anti-Catholic. And yet the real thing is so much worse than anything I've ever seen on tv or the movies. A living self-parody. That's Donohue.\n\nDonohue is a prick.\n\nI went to Catholic school for six years, and I know wanton jerks like this like the back of my hand.\n\nSomebody needs to call him what he is, a fear-mongering little bigot, on national TV and be done with it.\n\nI know, I know, it makes for good ratings, but someone has to start saying no to people like Donohue et al and stop booking them on TV.\n\nIf Obama can freeze out Fox, then why can't other outlets start refusing to have on people like this?\n\nIndeed, to anyone who grew up in a traditional Catholic environnment, Donohue is a wearily familiar \"type.\" This small-bore neighborhood lawyer, with his red face and the huge class ring on his finger, his arrogance and gamecock bravado... He is an authoritarian bully, no question about it, utterly consumed with anger and resentment, sex-obsessed. His hatred and anger have multiple sources, too layered to explicate in a blog comment. I know some people like him and even have a few in my extended family, and on a personal level, I feel nothing but pity for them. Believe me, they are deeply unhappy people. Although pitiable as an individual, however, Donohue and others like him are an evil influence on society, and they simply must be fought, through riposte and exposure. Media Matters performs a valuable service in tracking people of this sort and responding, calmly and rationally, to their falsehoods and slanders. Donohue himself cannot be reasoned with, but those who are influenced by him and especially those who give him air time, can.\n\nWhat exactly did they write that he found offensive?\n\nIndeed, to anyone who grew up in a traditional Catholic environnment, Donohue is a wearily familiar \"type.\" [...] He is an authoritarian bully, no question about it, utterly consumed with anger and resentment, sex-obsessed.\n\nWell, yeah...but hasn't O'Reilly pretty much cornered this particular market by now? I mean, many straight white Catholic males with chips on their shoulders the size of Nevada does the media really need, anyway?\n\nWow, his pathetic bleatings during the segment on \"Lucky Louie\" really go beyond the pale. Bill Donohue is a sad, sad little man, and as Louis C.K. should have said more loudly, he's a liar.\n\n\"What exactly did they write that he found offensive?\"\n\nWell, first of all, women aren't supposed to write. They're supposed to be seen and not heard, barefoot and pregnant, raise the kids and cook dinner, etc. If women do write, they should only write about topics Bill holds dear i.e. the Church is awesome, men know best, gays and jews are both evil and dangerous, Hollywood loves anal sex even more than he loves talking about it...Get the picture?\n\n\nThe best part of Bill Donohue ran down his mama's leg.\n\nUm... OK, reading these quotes from Bill Donohue, all I can do is paint a picture for you:\n\nI'm at my keyboard. At the first sentence, I roll my eyes. At the next two, I progress to chuckling out loud, incredulously, as my eyes widen in that grin-with-roller-coaster look you get when someone's just going off.\n\nAre you guys there with that?\n\nThe comments to this entry are closed."}

Perhaps worst of all, their placards are confiscated when city and state police write the citations, according to the Chicago Sun-Times and the Chicago Tribune.\n\nSo far, in a sting operation that has been ongoing for approximately six weeks, there have been 41 placards confiscated and 47 citations. That's about one person penalized for every five checks, despite prior publicity about the enforcement program. Just on Friday morning, a team of officers wrote four tickets and confiscated three placards in the downtown area.\n\nPenalties for abusing the handicapped parking privilege, which allows holders to park for free in Chicago metered areas and use conveniently located handicapped spots, will increase Jan. 1, after which abusers could have their driver's licenses revoked.\n\n\u201cI believe it is a violation of all laws of human decency for an individual to take advantage of a program that has been set aside for those who are truly in need,\u201d said Secretary of State Jesse White. \u201cOur mission is to make sure that those placards remain in the hands of those who are truly in need.\u201d\n\nMayor Rahm Emanuel also introduced legislation this week to make it harder to get a placard. If it is approved by the city council, new restrictions would require applicants to live in the same household as the handicapped person and limit the number of disabled parking spots on any one block, according to additional Chicago Sun-Times and Chicago Tribune articles. Officials would also check to see whether applicants already have accessible parking at their own homes before establishing new handicapped spots for individuals on residential blocks.\n\nA Chicagoist article provides additional details.\n\nRelated coverage:\n\nABAJournal.com: \"Busted: Fla.

{"dataman_score": 4.0, "text": "Ritual purification\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\nJump to: navigation, search\nMale Ablution Facility at University of Toronto's Multifaith Centre\n\nRitual purification is a feature of many religions. The aim of these rituals is to remove specifically defined uncleanliness prior to a particular type of activity, and especially prior to the worship of a deity. This ritual uncleanliness is not identical with ordinary physical impurity, such as dirt stains; nevertheless, body fluids are generally considered ritually unclean.\n\nMost of these rituals existed long before the germ theory of disease, and figure prominently from the earliest known religious systems of the Ancient Near East. Some writers remark that similarities between cleansing actions, engaged in by obsessive compulsive disorder sufferers and those of religious purification rites, point to an ultimate origin of the rituals in the personal grooming behaviour of the primates, but others connect the rituals to primitive taboos.\n\nSome have seen benefits of these practices that as a point of health and preventing infections especially in areas where humans come in close contact with each other. While these practices came before the idea of the germ theory was public in areas that use daily cleaning, the destruction of infectious agents seems to be dramatic.[1]\n\nBah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith[edit]\n\nIn the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith, ritual ablutions (the washing of the hands and face) should be done before the saying of the obligatory prayers, as well as prior to the recitation of the Greatest Name 95 times.[2] Menstruating women are obliged to pray and fast, but have the (voluntary) alternative of reciting a verse instead; if the latter choice is taken, ablutions are still required before the recital of the special verse. Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h, the founder of the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith, prescribed the ablutions in his book of laws, the Kit\u00e1b-i-Aqdas.[2]\n\nThat ablutions have a significance beyond washing, and should be performed even if one has bathed oneself immediately before reciting the obligatory prayer; fresh ablutions should also be performed for each devotion, unless they are being done at the same time. If no water is available, or when clean water is not available or when suffering from an illness which would be worsened by the use of water, then one may instead repeat the verse \"In the Name of God, the Most Pure, the Most Pure\" five times before the prayer.[2]\n\nApart from this, Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h abolished all forms of ritual impurity of people and things and stressed the importance of cleanliness and spiritual purity.[3]\n\n\nMain article: Tsukubai\nTsukubai at Ry\u014dan-ji temple in Kyoto.\n\nIn Japanese Buddhism, a basin called a tsukubai is provided at Buddhist temples for ablutions. It is also used for tea ceremony.\n\n\nMain articles: Ablution in Christianity and Lavabo\n\nBaptism, as a form of ritual purification, occurs in several religions related to Judaism, and most prominently in Christianity; Christianity also has other forms of ritual purification. In older churches, and modern Roman Catholic churches, there are a number of lavers around the building for the laity to use as ritual symbolism of cleansing themselves, usually by dipping the fingertips in the holy water, and then making the sign of the cross. In traditional liturgical churches a laver, often embedded in the wall, exists for the priest and deacon to wash their hands before celebrating the Eucharist.\n\nMany ancient churches were built with a large fountain in the courtyard. It was the tradition for Christians to wash before entering the church for worship. This usage is also legislated in the Rule of St. Benedict, as a result of which, many medieval monasteries were built with communal lavers for the monks or nuns to wash up before the Daily Office.\n\nTraditionally, Christianity adhered to the biblical regulation requiring the purification of women after childbirth; this practice, was adapted into a special ritual known as the churching of women, for which there exists liturgy in the Church of England's Book of Common Prayer, but its use is now rare in Western Christianity. The churching of women is still performed in a number of Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox and Eastern Catholic churches.\n\nRoman Catholics, Eastern Orthodox and High church Anglicans are also traditionally required to regularly attend confession, as a form of ritual purification from sin, especially as preparation before receiving the Eucharist. For Catholics, this is required at least once a year and required for those who are guilty of unconfessed mortal sins.[4]\n\nIn Reformed Christianity, ritual purity is achieved though the Confession of Sins, and Assurance of Forgiveness, and Sanctification. Through the power of the Holy Spirit, believers offer their whole being and labor as a 'living sacrifice'; and cleanliness becomes a way of life (See Romans 12:1, and John 13:5-10 (the Washing of the Feet)).\n\n\nVarious traditions within Hinduism follow different standards of ritual purity and purification; in Smartism, for example, the attitude to ritual purity is similar to that of Karaite Judaism. Within each tradition the more orthodox groups follow stricter rules, but the strictest rules are generally prescribed for brahmins, especially those engaged in the temple worship.\n\nAn important part of ritual purification in Hinduism is the bathing of the entire body, particularly in rivers considered holy such as the Ganges; it is considered auspicious to perform this form of purification before any festival, and it is also practised after the death of someone, in order to maintain purity. Although water pollution means that in modern times there is a need for care during bathing in such rivers, the physical impurities within the river do not diminish the attributed power they have to bring ritual purity. Lesser aspects of Hindu purification ritual include achamana - the touching and sipping of pure water while reciting specific mantras - and the application of a tilaka on the forehead.\n\nPunyahavachanam is a ritual performed before any ceremony such as Marriage,Homa etc. Mantras are chanted and then water is sprinkled over all the people participating and the items used.\n\nIn the ritual known as abhisheka (Sanskrit, \"sprinkling; ablution\"), the deity's murti or image is ritually bathed with water, curd, milk, honey, ghee, cane sugar, rosewater, etc. Abhisheka is also a special form of puja prescribed by Agamic injunction. The act is also performed in the inauguration of religious and political monarchs and for other special blessings.\n\nThere are various kinds of purificatory rituals associated with death ceremonies. After visiting a house where a death has recently occurred, Hindus are expected to take bath.\n\nWomen take a head bath after completing their 4 day menstrual period.\n\nIndigenous American religions[edit]\n\n\"El Infiernito\" (The Little hell) Ruins of an ancient Muisca shrine, place of purification rituals\n\nIn the traditions of many Indigenous peoples of the Americas, one of the forms of ritual purification is the ablutionary use of a sauna, known as a sweatlodge, as preparation for a variety of other ceremonies. The burning of smudge sticks is also believed by some indigenous groups to cleanse an area of any evil presence. Some groups like the southeastern tribe, the Cherokee, practiced and, to a lesser degree, still practice going to water, performed only in bodies of water that move like rivers or streams. Going to water was practiced by some villages daily (around sunrise) while others would go to water primarily for special occasions, including but not limited to naming ceremonies, holidays, and ball games.[5] Many anthropologists that studied with the Cherokees like James Adair tried to connect these groups to the Lost Tribes of Israel based on religious practices including going to water,[6] but this form of historiography is mostly Christian \"wish fulfillment\" rather than respectable anthropology.\n\n\nMain article: Hygiene in Islam\nPeople washing before prayer at the Badshahi mosque in Lahore, Pakistan.\n\nIslamic ritual purification is particularly centred on the preparation for ritual prayer; theoretically ritual purification would remain valid throughout the day, but is treated as invalid on the occurrence of certain acts, flatulence, sleep, contact with the opposite gender (depending on which school of thought), unconsciousness, and the emission of blood, semen, or vomit. Some schools of thought mandate that ritual purity is necessary for holding the Qur'an.\n\nRitual purification takes the form of ablution, in a lesser form (wudu), and greater form (ghusl), depending on the circumstance; the greater form is obligatory by a woman after she ceases menstruation, on a corpse that didn't die during battle and after sexual activity, and is optionally used on other occasions, for example just prior to Friday prayers or entering ihram.\n\nAn alternative \"dry ablution\"(tayammum), involving clean sand or earth, is used if clean water is not available or if suffering from an illness which would be worsened by the use of water; this form is invalidated in the same circumstances as the other forms, and also whenever water becomes available and safe to use. And is also necessary to be repeated (renewed) before every obligatory prayer.\n\nThe obligatory activities of the lesser form include beginning with the intention to purify oneself, washing of the face, arms, head, and feet. while some optional acts also exist such as recitation of the Bismillah, Oral hygiene / the brushing of the teeth, the washing of the mouth, nose at the beginning, washing of arms to the elbows and washing of the ears at the end; additionally recitation of the Shahadah. The greater form (ghusl) is completed by first performing wudu and then ensuring that the entire body is washed. Some minor details of Islamic ritual purification may vary between different schools of thought as well as scholarly opinions and between the different sects of Islam.\n\n\nPool of a medieval mikvah in Speyer, dating back to 1128 .\n\nThe Hebrew Bible has many rituals of purification relating to menstruation, childbirth, sexual relations, nocturnal emission, unusual bodily fluids, skin disease, death, and animal sacrifices. Modern mainstream Judaism is based on a combination of the Hebrew Bible and Jewish oral law, which includes the Mishnah and Gemarrah (together comprising the Talmud) in addition to other rabbinic commentaries; this oral law further specifies regulations for ritual purity, including obligations relating to excretory functions, meals, and waking. The regulations of biblical and oral law generally prescribe a form of water-based ritual washing in Judaism for removal of any ritual impurity, sometimes requiring just washing of the hands, and at other times requiring full immersion; the oral law requires the use of un-drawn water for any ritual full immersion - either a natural river/stream/spring, or a special bath (a Mikvah) which contains rain-water.\n\nThese regulations were variously observed by the ancient Israelites; contemporary Orthodox Jews and (with some modifications and additional leniencies) some Conservative Jews continue to observe the regulations, except for those tied to sacrifice in the Temple in Jerusalem, as the Temple no longer fully exists. These groups continue to observe many of the hand washing rituals. Of those connected with full ritual immersion; perhaps the quintessential immersion rituals still carried out are those related to nidda, according to which a menstruating woman must avoid contact with her husband, especially avoiding sexual contact, and may only resume contact after she has first immersed herself fully in a mikvah of living water seven days after her menstruation has ceased.\n\nIn December 2006 the Committee on Jewish Law and Standards of Conservative Judaism re-affirmed the traditional requirement that Conservative women ritually immerse following menstruation. In doing so, it adopted multiple opinions regarding details, including an opinion reaffirming traditional (Orthodox) practices and concepts, an opinion adapting certain leniencies including counting seven days from start of menstruation rather than its end, and an opinion reformulating the theological basis of the practice, basing it on concepts other than ritual purity. See the Niddah article for details. Classical ritual immersion and associated requirements are generally not observed by Reform Judaism or Reconstructionist Judaism, with the exception that both generally include immersion as part of the ritual for Conversion to Judaism, although Reform Judaism does not require it.\n\nTumat HaMet (\"The impurity of death\"), coming into contact with a human corpse, is considered the ultimate impurity, one which cannot be purified through the waters of the mikvah. Tumat HaMet required purification through sprinkling of the ashes of the Parah Adumah, the Red Heifer. However the law is inactive, since neither the Temple in Jerusalem nor the red heifer is currently in existence, though without the latter a Jew is forbidden to ascend to the site of the former. All are currently assumed to possess the impurity of death.[7] However, someone who is a Kohen, one of the priestly class, is not allowed to intentionally come into contact with a dead body, nor approach too closely to graves within a Jewish cemetery.\n\nKaraite Jews are the only Jewish movement that continues the observance of the laws of ritual purity as they are written in the Torah.[citation needed]\n\nKalash (polytheists in the mountains of Pakistan)[edit]\n\nKalash theology has very strong notions of purity and impurity. Menstruation is confirmation of women's impurity and when their periods begin they must leave their homes and enter the village menstrual building or \"bashaleni\". Only after undergoing a purification ceremony restoring their purity can they return home and rejoin village life. The husband is an active participant in this ritual.\n\nWestern ocultism/esotericism[edit]\n\nMain article: Banishing\n\nIn Ceremonial magic, banishing refers to one or more rituals intended to remove non-physical influences ranging from spirits to negative influences.[8] Although banishing rituals are often used as components of more complex ceremonies, they can also be performed by themselves.\n\nIn Wicca and various forms of neopaganism, banishing is performed before casting a Circle in order to purify the area where the ritual or magick is about to take place. In his books on Nocturnal Witchcraft, for example, Konstantinos recommends performing banishings regularly, in order to keep the magickal workspace free of negativity, and to become proficient in banishing before attempting acts that are much more spiritually taxing on the body, such as magickal spellworking.[9] Banishing can be viewed as one of several techniques of magick, closely related to ritual purification and a typical prerequisite for consecration and invocation.\n\nFor \"actual workings\" Aleister Crowley recommends a short, general banishing, with a comment that \"in more elaborate ceremonies it is usual to banish everything by name.\" [8]\n\nCrowley also recommended that a banishing ritual be done at least once daily by Thelema in Liber Aleph vel CXI.[10]\n\nIn the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram (LBRP for shorthand) must be learned by the Neophyte before moving on to the next grade (Zelator).[11][12]\n\n\n\nMain article: Misogi\n\nIn Shinto, the main form of ritual purification is Misogi, which involves natural running water, and especially waterfalls. Rather than being entirely naked, men usually wear Japanese loincloths and women wear kimonos, both additionally wearing headbands.\n\nSee also[edit]\n\n\n  1. ^ \"Nitten Soji and the prevention of infections\" Classical fighting arts vol 2 #18\n  2. ^ a b c Smith, Peter (2000). \"ablutions\".

Upon our arrival, the man at the desk took extra time to help us find things to do that evening and over the weekend. The inn features nine guest rooms, plus a lounge/library area upstairs. Our room was comfortable, but a bit on the cramped side, and most of the lighting and plumbing fixtures seemed like holdovers from the 1980s. The showerhead was of the stinging, high-pressure variety found in locker rooms. We tend to dock lodgings quite a few points for such an oversight because investing 50 bucks could significantly upgrade the guest experience. What we did love, though, was the inn\u2019s breakfast, served in a high-ceilinged dining room downstairs. The service was attentive and the menu loaded with baked goodies like cherry muffins.\n\nOctober 19, 2012\n\nAdd Your Comment"}

Betaworks is also an investor in Summize.\n\nHere's the official blog post.\n\nThe idea of is that a lot more could be done with url-shorteners. I found I needed to develop my own for the NewsJunk project. They asked what it would take for me to use, I said: data. I need to know how many clicks each pointer got and where the clicks came from.\n\nThey gave me that, and thumbnails, permanent caching of the pages I'm pointing to (goodbye linkrot) and a lot of smart stuff going on behind the scenes that we're not ready to talk about yet. (Though we told Marshall and he explained.) Here's the info page for this post.\n\nAnd, most important, an XML/JSON interface, so I can process all that data with my own programs. Here's the XML readout for the shortened link to this post.\n\nI'm a minority shareholder in this project, so know that I have a considerable interest in its success. Of course I think it's a great service, and I hope you give it a try.\n\nOver on ReadWriteWeb, Allen Stern asks if there's a way to make money, and there is. We'll hopefully be ready to talk about it in a couple of weeks.\n\nWhich way will Twitter go?\u00a0Permanent link to this item in the archive.\n\nA picture named sailboat.gifBiz Stone posted yesterday about the status of services connected to Twitter via their XMPP gateway. We knew about Summize, suspected that FriendFeed had a deal, and learned that there are two others.\n\nWe'd like to see Twitter connect their full output to anyone who wants it, but without directly saying so, Stone implies that there are technical reasons they can't.\n\nI am not an expert on XMPP so I have to defer to others who are. They say it would be possible for Summize to allow anyone to subscribe to the flow they receive from Twitter, and this would be transparent to Twitter.\n\nGnip, a company whose founders I interviewed last week, asked for this arrangement, and even thought Summize was willing to provide them with the flow, Twitter said no.\n\nThis is a clear indication that it is an economic issue, not a technical one.\n\nI wrote yesterday that changes things, offering a public utility model to compete with Twitter's company-owned model. It is built around the assumption that anyone can hook into the stream of any server, allowing a \"federation\" where being a citizen of one community means that you're a citizen of every community.\n\nIt seems then, long-term, there are three options for Twitter.\n\n1. Open up their XMPP interface to all interested service providers, with the help of the community, so that it has no impact on the scaling of their servers. I'm almost 100 percent sure the developers would rally around such an idea, and help Twitter get this going.\n\n2. Wait, and support the same federation protocol as, allowing Twitter users to participate in that community, on equal terms.\n\n3. Build AOL-like barriers around their service, to force users to connect to Twitter users only through their software.\n\nObviously, from the way I've written it, you can tell that I think #3 is not really an option, not if they want to learn from the experience of instant messaging.\n\nIt seems to me that blogging, which came after IM, set the precedent for Twitter-like services, and while the compatibility between blogging services isn't perfect, it's pretty good. Because of RSS (and RDF and Atom), and the two blogging APIs (Blogger and Metaweblog) you have fairly good interop.

{"dataman_score": 4.0, "text": "First, I want to warn everyone that this article may not be safe for work (or even safe for life). Edward Gein was one of the creepiest, craziest, and most deranged individuals to have ever lived, and he is the core inspiration for countless horror characters, films, books, and plays.\n\nCharacters inspired by Edward Gein:\n\n  \u2022 Norman Bates (Psycho)\n  \u2022 Leatherface (The Texas Chainsaw Massacre)\n  \u2022 Buffalo Bill (The Silence of the Lambs)\n\nWho is Edward Gein?\n\nEdward Gein was an American murderer and body snatcher. He would sneak into gravesites and exhume corpses, bringing their remains back to his humble abode. With these remains, he would fashion clothing, furniture, and other knickknacks. When investigated, Gein admitted to making as many as 40 trips to three local graveyards near his house, yet he claimed to be in a \u201cdaze-like\u201d state during most of those trips.\n\nEdward Gein\n\nEdward Gein.\n\nSimilarity to Norman Bates:\n\n  \u2022 Similar to the character seen in Psycho, Gein had an odd fascination with corpses that resembled his mother, and he would only exhume the graves of recently buried middle-aged women.\n  \u2022 When Gein\u2019s mother died, Gein remained in the house, yet he boarded up most of the rooms used by his mother. He lived in a small room next to the kitchen.\nNorman Bates\n\nNorman Bates.\n\nSimilarity to Leatherface:\n\n  \u2022 Leatherface\u2019s name stems from his masks crafted from human skin. When the police finally raided Gein\u2019s house, they found nine masks of human skin, among other paraphernalia crafted from human remains.\n  \u2022 In the original film depicting Leatherface, he wore three different masks, with each one representing a different personality. Edward Gein claimed that his fascination of masks fashioned from human skin came from his struggle with his sexuality and his personality.\n\n\nSimilarity to Buffalo Bill:\n\n  \u2022 If you have seen The Silence of the Lambs, you understand the creepiness of Buffalo Bill, and you may also remember his infamous dress fashioned from human skin. Yup, that\u2019s not just a fictionalized creation of someone\u2019s morbid mind. An incomplete skin dress was found in Edward Gein\u2019s house. If that doesn\u2019t make your skin crawl, you have nerves of steel.\nBuffalo Bill\n\nBuffalo Bill.\n\n  1. Jo says:\n\n    Books on serial killers and strange/deranged criminals have always interested me, I think I started reading them when I was like 11 and Ed Gein has always fascinated me. I think they based Hannibal Lecter on him too.\n\nHave Your Say"}

{"dataman_score": 4.0, "text": "What Do Words Mean to Dogs?\n\nOne of the segments on the BBC show The Secret Life of Dogs that generated several interesting comments was the segment that showed \u201cBetsy,\u201d (not her real name, you gotta love that some dogs now have \u2018nom de plumes\u2019) retrieving an object after being shown just a photograph of it. Wow. That truly is amazing. It got me to thinking about the trouble I had a year or so ago when I tried to teach Willie to discriminate between toys based on a name. For over a year he\u2019d been told to \u201cGo get your toy,\u201d and he\u2019d pick out whatever toy he liked best that was nearby.\n\nWhen I tried to teach him to touch or pick up a toy based on a different word (\u201cball\u201d or \u201crope\u201d), he became hopelessly confused. He became so stressed over the entire operation that I dropped it and went on to teach him other things. My best guess is that he had categorized all signals as requests for action, not as labels of an object. That\u2019s a pretty big frame shift to make. And yet, here is Betsy, able to pick out 250 different objects by name and by just looking at a 2-dimensional photograph (which dogs, by the way, were not supposed to be able to do). And of course, there\u2019s Rico, the other famous BC, who could not only pick out hundreds of objects, he could get the larger of two versions, AND could \u2018fast map,\u2019 or be asked to retrieve something he\u2019d never heard of or seen before, and deduce that it was the only unfamiliar object in a group of familiar toys. Wow. These are some smart dogs.\n\nWill now has learned labels of living things: he knows \u201cJim\u201d and \u201cTrisha\u201d and \u201cSushi.\u201d I can say \u201cGo to the Barn\u201d or \u201cGo up the hill\u201d and he runs the right way, but I suspect he doesn\u2019t think of the \u201cbarn\u201d or \u201chill\u201d as a label of the object itself, but rather of an action and direction. The BBC segment got me rethinking about what Willie understands as an action and what he understands as a label. He knows \u201cget your toy\u201d\u2026 and I suspect understands that \u201ctoy\u201d relates to the objects he plays with, but does he see it as a label or as an action? Is it more about playing with anything in front of him, or the objects themselves?\n\nI\u2019m inspired now to start testing this out with Will. I\u2019m going to write down every word and movement I make that I think might be a cue to him, and what I think it means to him. This, needless to say, is going to take some time, so stay tuned for what I come up with. Meanwhile, I\u2019d love to hear from you. How much of what your dog understands relates to an action, and how much is it a label of an object? Is there any difference between learning to label a living thing versus an non-living object? Willie definitely knows \u201csheep\u201d and \u201cSushi,\u201d and I wonder if it matters that the \u2018object\u2019 of a label is living or not? He knew all the names of my other dogs, in that he\u2019d turn and look at them if I said \u201cWhere\u2019s Lassie?\u201d He gets excited when I say \u201cDinner,\u201d but does it mean the actual food itself, or the action of eating them? See how interesting this can get?\n\nMeanwhile, back at the farm: We are all continuing to heal. Willie played for hours with his new friend, Max, an adolescent Border Collie who lives not far away. Watching them run and run and run huge circles around the Orchard Pasture cheered me up immensely. The best part of it was the way they played, because Willie didn\u2019t always play as well with others. Willie would start running with another dog, then get in front and air snap toward their face to stop their forward movement. Then he\u2019d stand still with a satisfied look on his face. Look what I accomplished! Boy, am I a good herding dog! Eventually the other dog would just stop running, because what was the point? However, recently the lovely Dobberman Mishka seemed to have taught Willie to stop playing by herding. Mishka put up with his \u201cherding\u201d two times, and then growl-charged at Willie. Totally appropriate, very controlled; I remember saying \u201cGood girl!\u201d I was so impressed. Willie backed off with that confused, silly look that male dogs get around females who discipline them, and never tried it again. They began racing instead and now it\u2019s Willie\u2019s favorite game.\n\nIt helps that Max is fast. Really fast, and so is Willie, but neither can really beat the other, so they run and run and run in the snow, stop and get their breath and then run some more. And you\u2019d think that would have tired Willie out enough to sleep through the evening? Of course not, he kept dropping toys in our lap all evening long. I think it just warmed him up. Here\u2019s some photos of Max and Willie playing. Not the best photographs, but I love how it shows the world we live in right now. Black and white (dogs). Black and white (everything else!)\n\n\n  1. says\n\n    I\u2019ve seen a dog who was trained to \u201cread\u201d. You could hold up a flashcard with various words written in block letters, like Sit and Down. Of course, the dog had just been taught to associate the shape of the word with an action, not to actually read, but it was still pretty cool. I haven\u2019t watched the special yet, but it seems like Betsy could easily have learned to associate a particular picture with the act of retrieving a particular toy, without understanding that the picture was *of* the toy.\n\n    Corrie knows some toy names\u2026\u201dball\u201d, \u201cblue toy\u201d, \u201cfrisbee\u201d (although we have to call it \u201cthe magical flying disk\u201d while we\u2019re in the house, lest he start bouncing off the walls). And he knows some locations, like the kitchen and the bathroom. And he can even tie them together sometimes, like \u201cget your ball from the bathroom\u201d. But I think you\u2019re onto something with that being words for an action in his mind, not for the actual place or item.\n\n  2. Frances says\n\n    I am glad that the healing has started for you all \u2013 and what a wonderful time the two BCs are having!\n\n    Like you, I am fascinated by the subject of dogs and language. Mine must have a hell of a time trying to pick out meaningful terms and actions from the constant flow that comes their way, though! Starting agility has shown me just how imprecise (to be kind!) my communication can be with them \u2013 it really would help if I could remember the names of the pieces of equipment, and my left from my right, and run at the same time.\n\n    I was interested to come across Sean Senechal\u2019s books on canine sign language \u2013 although more than a bit sceptical, too, especially when I realised the most glowing review of the book was written by the author. Has anyone any experience of teaching their dogs to communicate with them through signing, beyond the scratch-at-the-door or kick-the-water-bowl level? It would be amazing if it worked, but I was rather put off in the first few pages, when she used \u201cliteracy\u201d to mean capability for language \u2013 much as I would like my dogs to settle down quietly with a good book, I think they are more likely to want to chew it than read it \u2026\n\n  3. Amy W. says\n\n    Betsy was amazing!\n\n    The first time I really took notice and was amazed at my dog\u2019s ability to understand what I was saying and take action on it was when I realized he understood the phrase \u2018LET\u2019S GO HOME.\u2019 I take him to the park daily, and somewhere along the way, without realizing it, when it was time to leave I would say \u2018let\u2019s go home,\u2019 and walk to the car. Then one day at the park, I said \u2018let\u2019s go home\u2019 and my dog, Axle, stopped turned around and ran to the car and waited for me to open the door.\n\n    After thinking about it, a lot of things that he has learned are actions rather than labels. Even if I formally train him, it\u2019s still usually an action that I want from him: sit, down, come, etc.\n\n    The pictures are great, I especially like the top one.\n\n  4. Mary Beth says\n\n    How fascinating! I agree\u2026my dogs understand the action not the word. I hadn\u2019t put two and two together until you said that.\n    I suppose scent articles in competitive obedience are the same way. The dog\u2019s aren\u2019t focusing on the objects in the pile, they are \u201cgoing\u201d and \u201cscenting\u201d.\n    My dogs have a huge vocabulary, but I\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019re right, they are all actions, not labels.\n\n  5. JJ says\n\n    I can\u2019t think of anything I\u2019ve taught my dog that wasn\u2019t an action or can\u2019t easily be interpreted as an action.\n\n    Duke\u2019s bag of action tricks: sit, down, lie flat as a pancake, turn left, turn right (his left and right), get in the car, go potty, back, off, drop it, find it, catch (the food that I\u2019m throwing in your general direction), etc.\n\n    OK, here\u2019s one for you: Is \u201cstay\u201d an action?\n    I know it\u2019s still more of a body thing than an understanding of a noun. It just struck as me as funny to include it in the list of action tricks above.\n\n  6. says\n\n    What a fascinating subject! I never though of it before, but it seems obvious now why my dogs are so easily confused when I ask them to get a specific toy. They dash of at the \u201cGO GET YOU\u2026\u201d part and then grab whatever is near, look at me with question marks in their eyes and seem to wonder that sometimes I am all excited about (when they got what I had in mind) it and sometime just look back expressionless (when it was not). However, they seem to be better with living beings, like a person or another pet. I wonder why that is the case?\n\n  7. Kristen says\n\n    My dog Belle does understand the difference between her toys. She can bring back (with reasonable accuracy)her: ball, tug, chewie, chickie, birdie, frisbee, blue cheeseburger, frogball, and raccoon. I feel pretty certain that she understands the nouns differentiate which toy she is supposed to bring. Otherwise I think most of the rest of what she understands is likely tied to action\u2026 \u201cgo to (back yard, flyball, Grandma\u2019s, etc.)\u201d The only one I\u2019m not sure about is \u201cRoxy\u201d, her best dog friend. I don\u2019t know if she knows that \u201cRoxy\u201d means \u201cthe dog\u201d or \u201cplaying with the dog\u201d. Not sure how to test that one.\n\n  8. JJ says\n\n    Here\u2019s some thoughts this discussion has fired in my brain:\n\n    A poster above talked about being able to distinguish when her dog is barking at a person coming to her gate vs a squirrel in the yard. I would say that the dog is communicating about different nouns/things/persons as opposed to actions. So, if a dog can communicate/use his/her \u201cwords\u201d to distinguish between nouns, why wouldn\u2019t they be able to understand our words to distinguish between objects?\n\n    Alternatively, could we speculate that the dog is communicating that a person is \u201ccoming\u201d vs a squirrel is \u201crunning\u201d??? More about actions that objects? Perhaps the dog is communicating that \u201cI want to *greet* a person\u201d vs \u201cI want to *chase* a squirrel\u201d. Would it be the same bark for all desires to chase vs all desires to greet? In other words, is the different barking words really about an action the dog wants to do?\n\n    As speculated above, perhaps it is a matter of training. After all, isn\u2019t this whole area of science about \u201cbehavior modification\u201d? About training behaviors? We\u2019ve been focused for years on verbs. So, it is any wonder that that is what our dogs exhibit in response to our words? Even our experiments testing a dog\u2019s understanding of a word revolves around an action. For example, *point* to the object whose word I just said. Perhaps we need better experiments?\n\n    Here\u2019s an honest question: How much does it matter? What would we learn if we find out that X% of dogs can indeed understand that different words mean different objects. Or what if we learn that dogs can only pick up actions from our words? What would that change? I\u2019m not being critical of the discussion. I\u2019m just trying to understand, \u201cwhat\u2019s the big picture\u201d? Why do we care beyond academic curiosity?\n\n  9. says\n\n\n    this happened several times with the horses over the weekend. We have 3 horses, 2 mares, 1 gelding. In this weather when the footing is too slippery they don\u2019t get a lot of .real. excercise so they are a little wound up. Lucky for us, we have a beautiful indoor arena to turn them out in. When the 3 are out together, my mare seems to be the \u201cfun police\u201d and she will get in front of the other two, bounce to a stop and either buck or kick at them. I am sure this is to control forward movement, which worked most of the time. Once they slowed down, she would trot forward and do it again if they sped up.\n\n    My dogs are not so advanced as to understand words, but if I remember right the Cattle Dog, Skid boot, knew a huge vocab.\n\n  10. says\n\n    I have tried to teach my dogs \u201cgo find\u201d a certain person, but so far they have not got the names down. If I say \u201cgo find Michael\u201d they will just go to the nearest person they find, or if we\u2019re playing hide and seek they will search for whoever is missing.\n\n  11. says\n\n    I lived with Labs for years. Big-hearted and brave, lovey and loyal, sloppy, goofy Labs. Purebred or mixed, some were smarter than others, but they\u2019d all do ANYthing for food, even pretend they knew what I was talking about (well, maybe not don\u2019t pull on the leash). If food was the endgame, any of them would and did do most of what I wanted. Like dogs do, each of them gave me generous gifts in return.\n\n    The last one, beautiful brown Gracey, had a horrible beginning and came from our humane society loaded with neuroses and wildly reactive behavior. Her amazing gift was to teach me what it is to bring a dog back from the brink with patience, consistency and love. After dying of bone cancer 5 years later, she sent me back to the shelter to get someone who is arguably the best gift of all.\n\n    From the minute he looked up at me from under his lashes, I felt Garrett was sent to me as a sort of reward for everything I\u2019d ever done right for dogs. Not a Lab (surprise!), but an alien, some sort of handsome herder, he\u2019s a dog so willing and smart that even at the age of 18 months, I never had to teach him anything. I just let him know which things he does that I like. Really.\n\n    He came as a rezdog (reservation dog) stray from the Oklahoma Cherokee, so I made sure he understood this is his forever home, and he fit in easily. Yes, he somehow knows all of the usual obedience (sit, stay, come, heel, cross with the light, how to be welcome anywhere, pretty much anything at all), what all of his toys are individually called and where they are. As a matter of fact, he usually keeps them all in a neat pile and all of his bones in another. As part of our arrangement, he does everything as long as I ask for nothing. Sort of. He charms everyone he meets, I don\u2019t ask him to love cats or squirrels, and we both know how lucky we are. I am not making this up.\n\n  12. Trisha says\n\n    Re a few of the comments: I would never say that dogs can\u2019t learn to label objects. I think it is overwhelmingly true that they can, and that many do. But every dog is different, and it seems to be much harder for Willie than for some other dogs. I am just interested in how dogs perceive our cues, and how their are \u2018translated\u2019 from person to dog. Regarding why would we care\u2026? Well, partly it IS \u2018academic curiosity\u2019 for me. One of my first memories is lying on the living room floor, wondering what it was like inside the brain of my dog, Fudge. How much was it like mine? How different? That question has driven much of my life, so I guess I must think it\u2019s important!\n\n    But beyond that, I think there are some important practical reasons to ask those kinds of questions. One is that people often assume their dog understands a cue exactly as the person does, when in fact the dog has an entirely different definition of the word or action. (At first, \u201cWhere\u2019s Jim\u201d was defined by Will as run to the window and get excited about something wonderful about to happen. I didn\u2019t realize this until I said \u201cWhere\u2019s Jim?\u201d when he was sitting beside Jim.) Secondly, I think animal cognition is important relative to welfare issues. The more we discover about the internal states of sentient animals, the more some people will be might be willing to consider their welfare more seriously.\n\n    And, on another note: so interesting that Holly\u2019s horse \u2018played\u2019 the same way as Will!\n\n  13. says\n\n    This is all very interesting to me. My dogs have always have a good vocabulary. My current boy, Tag (chocolate lab \u2013 8 years old today!) knows much more than most people give him credit for. The best is when he brings me a shoe/slipper (without being asked\u2026and he does bring it to me\u2026that retriever thing going on, ya know), I tell him to \u201cgo get the other one\u201d and he does. He has done this since a wee pup. If I\u2019m sitting in my office and ask him to go get my slippers, he searches around the house until he finds them. If I say, \u201cin the living room\u201d, and point down the hall, he goes to the living room. Yeah, I know, cues given. He takes direction from pointing very well, too. Anyway. He knows the names of several of his toys\u2026warthog, kong, little kong (I find it amazing that he can differentiate between the two\u2026course, am sure I emphasize the word \u2018little\u2019), & ball. Those are the main ones. He also knows food dish. He will pick up anything from the floor that I ask him to (paper, phone, remote, book, fabric, etc.), though that is probably not pertinent to this conversation. ha. Just sayin\u2019.\n\n  14. says\n\n    Although Merlin will not \u201cgo find [object]\u201d I have figured out that he knows at least 100 words. Most of them are food/prey/fun related. Mention \u201cTastee Freeze\u201d in a sentence and he will head towards it on the next walk (even if that walk is 2 hours later). The neighbors know to call squirrels \u201cThe S word\u201d if he is within hearing or he will start scanning all the trees and telephone poles in the area. Most recently I realized he knew the word \u201csoup\u201d when I was talking to my mother on the phone and she asked what I was going to do with the leftovers I had. I gave the one word answer \u201cSoup.\u201d and he jumped up, looked at me, licked his lips, ran to the kitchen and sat by the stove.\n\n    He can also read the words \u201cSIT\u201d \u201cDOWN\u201d \u201cSTAND\u201d \u201cUP\u201d (ie beg) and \u201cSHAKE\u201d in both English and a symbolic language I made up, but if we don\u2019t practice it at least once a month he loses the ability and we have to start over from scratch. I worked on reading in the hopes that we could move on to words like \u201cCOOKIE\u201d and \u201cOUTSIDE\u201d so that he could communicate with me better, (no matter what he wants his method of telling me is to stand by me, stare and whine until I guess the right thing) but he couldn\u2019t get beyond the basic five commands.\n\n  15. Shalea says\n\n    I have tried to teach a dog labels for objects (his different toys), but the dog in question (greyhound) was really, really not interested. He seemed to appreciate the thought when I brought him a new toy, but that\u2019s about it.\n\n    My current dog is very nearly blind, and so I attempt to apply labels to sounds he reacts to (\u201cthat\u2019s a squirrel/truck/heat pump/etc.\u201d). Not sure if it\u2019s working (if he\u2019s applying the label I give to the sound he hears) or if he takes my acknowledgment of the sound as a sign that it\u2019s nothing he needs to be concerned with. It\u2019s worth noting that if I tell him \u201cthat\u2019s a person\u201d his reaction is entirely different than it is to other random noises (because people just might pat the dog). But he could just be associating the word with the action of getting patted.\n\n    We do play a label game with him \u2013 \u201cfind \u201d \u2013 but again, he\u2019s very inclined to seek out a person anyway so it\u2019s very hard to say if he associates the name of the person as a label for that person.\n\n  16. says\n\n    My young BC understands the word \u201cget\u201d and will wait for the name of what he is to go get. I tried to write down all the names of toys, objects, and people he knows \u2014 it\u2019s a long list! He has down at least 30 object names. And since he destroys a lot of toys, the list is continuing to evolve. I\u2019m not sure he understands \u201cgo\u201d, as I use it in agility too often. He\u2019s definitely more verbal than my Labs. The Labs tend to respond better to visual cues. Makes sense, in the field, you stop a Lab with a whistle, then give directional signals. BCs use the whistle as a verbal cue.\n\n    Interesting idea with the flash cards, I should try that! A great rainy day game.\n\n  17. Lacey H says\n\n    I\u2019ve noticed that several of my little foster dogs have learned the names of my dogs quickly, often before they\u2019ve learned their own new names \u2013 new because either they were strays, names unknown, or because they showed a bad reaction to the name they came in with, such as cowering. They showed they knew my dogs\u2019 names by turning to look at the dog I spoke to, without glancing at me first. I take glancing at me as the sign they\u2019ve begun to learn their new names.\n\n  18. Ed says\n\n    My dog knows the names of a couple dozen things, except when she doesn\u2019t. She\u2019s either at high-90-something percent accuracy, or pure chance (or worse \u2013 sometimes she just keeps targeting or grabbing the same thing over and over or runs up and down not targeting or fetching anything!), depending on her mood. When I was graphing what she learned, it was very clear that sometimes she didn\u2019t want to listen. (She knows several toys; some things I\u2019m likely to drop in the kitchen; the DVD, TV, and Cable remotes, some of her body parts, etc.)\n\n    However, she has never failed when I ask her to target a person by name. Not sure what that means.\n\n    I know dogs aren\u2019t supposed to generalize (and I\u2019ve never quite understood what that means). One rainy day, when I was trying to find things to do, I moved her \u201cplace,\u201d a cheap doormat, into various rooms and asked her to go to her place or put her back paws on her place or whatever. We eventually went into the den, which has a variety of throw rugs around, and I put her place behind a chair and called her in. Her first try was the closest rug \u2013 which by the way is at least 10 times the size of her place. Her next try was the next-closest rug. Obviously, although she knows the difference between her place and another dog\u2019s place (they\u2019re different colors and I assume smell different) she also knows that her \u201cplace\u201d is carpet and not hardwood. That\u2019s not an action, that\u2019s the nature of thing.\n\n    I\u2019m with Willie \u2013 there are some things that seem to come easily to most that are completely beyond me!\n\n    Merlin\u2019s Mom \u2013 the need for regular refresher courses is interesting. Do you have any thoughts about why the flashcards won\u2019t stick?\n\n  19. Carrie says\n\n    One of my BC\u2019s got really frustrated, just like you described Willie, when I tried to teach him the names of toys and asking him to touch the so and so toy. After reading this blog posting I would definetly say that he thinks of the words he knows as actions. \u201cFrisbee,\u201d is not a round disc, it is the act of playing fetch with that particular shaped object. I can only think of one label he might know as a label. When I am finished playing and my husband is still up for it, I will tell him \u201cI am all done, go play with daddy.\u201d Even then, he might think of \u201cdaddy,\u201d as the act of switching play mates.\n\n    This is also my boy who does not enjoy doing anything unless it has a purpose. He will do agility, but gets very frustrated because he doesn\u2019t see the point of it; \u201cbecause I said so\u201d just isn\u2019t enough. His agility frustration is an almost idential reaction to his label frustration. Maybe he is frustrated because he does not see the point to labels? He has all the capability of learning them, he is incredibly smart, it may be that he doesn\u2019t have the need for labels to communicate, so why learn them? I wonder how I could make labels \u201cworth it,\u201d in his mind to try this out.\n\n  20. David says\n\n    I\u2019m wondering how the ability to identify an object in a photograph relates to being able to identify something being reflected in a mirror. We have an English Shepherd puppy who at four months figured out how to look at something in a mirror and react to it as a reflection. (Which was the equivalent of me waving a toy behind him as he looked at me in the mirror.)\n\n  21. says\n\n    Excellent observation for words. My dogs understand words as things, and words as actions. They can even retrieve a specific toy, but only because they like it.\n\n  22. says\n\n    Although I haven\u2019t gone to really teach my two dogs a lot of different words, I know that they do understand many of them. For example, sometimes I\u2019ll just say the word \u2018ball\u2019 without one in sight and my boy will actually look in the direction of one or go to get one. Same thing with \u2018doggie\u2019. When I say that word, they know that there\u2019s either one outside or on TV.\n\n  23. Susan says\n\n    Hmmm, I\u2019m struck by the dog retrieving an item when shown the picture, as I\u2019m having difficulty teaching Arie \u201cmatch to sample\u201d with 3 dimensional objects. I\u2019ve backed off and been pondering how to do this, as she has a large history of reinforcement for hot targeting, and often ends up choosing an item she had previously chosen before in a prior trial (correctly, though purely by chance).\n\n    I\u2019ve been considering using a stack of cards like what is used in the kids memory game where you try to find the matched pairs, there are usually simple graphics of toys, etc. But, I\u2019m not sure if that would be too hard at this stage, was planning on doing that later. On the third hand, it might simplify things to not have a 3 dimensional object. And its a lot cheaper to print things up than to keep buying duplicates of various different objects, especially since at this point I\u2019m trying to avoid re-using objects until she gets a better handle on what I\u2019m looking for. On the fourth hand- maybe it is too visually difficult a task.\n\n  24. Alexandra says\n\n    Oh, that\u2019s a very interesting difference between types of labels. I had never thought of it that way before, but it makes a lot of sense. Copper, my lab, knows a lot of words. Now that I think of it, most of the words he knows refer to actions and living things. He is very interested in whatever his people are doing and seems to listen very carefully when we speak, often staring intently or cocking his head. We joke that he uses telepathy as I can generally figure out what he wants from his expressions when he stares at me.\n\n    I think he does know the words for \u201cgo get your\u2026 ball/stick/toy/tuggie/bone\u201d with toy being whatever object he wants and the others being specific things. He will usually bring the correct object that you ask him for, although I didn\u2019t make a concerted effort to teach him. I will play fetch or tug with any of those toys, so I don\u2019t think he considers their names as referring to a specific activity. I think those are about the only object labels he knows. He definitely knows the names of living things like kitties, deer, bunny, my husband, other family members, his best dog friends, and places like upstairs, car, and outside. All the other many words I can think of refer to commands to action such as obedience and agility commands, or things he can do like \u201cgo lie down,\u201d and \u201cwho wants dinner?\u201d\n\n    That is pretty amazing that the dog can find an object from a photo. I can\u2019t wait to watch that BBC special.\n\n  25. Roberta says\n\n    I have observed that consistency matters. My husband calls my dog\u2019s toys \u201ctoys.\u201d I call her toys with eyes (no matter how many legs the toy has \u2014 or how many eyes \u2014 \u201cdollies.\u201d I tell her to go find a \u201cdolly\u201d so we can \u201cfetch\u201d and she will. If I tell her to go get the \u201cother one,\u201d she will. If I ask her to fetch and she comes back without her \u201cdolly,\u201d I tell her, \u201cWhere\u2019s your dolly?\u201d and she\u2019ll go get it. She reacts much faster when I use the \u201csign language\u201d of my hands opening up and out to show her that my hands are empty and I don\u2019t have a dolly.\n\n    At a time, I envisioned that I would teach her to distinguish between her toys, put her toys in her box, take a particular one out, and deliver a particular one to her papa, but she can\u2019t see the use in it and would rather pester the cat, who doesn\u2019t have to understand language because he reads minds (smiles).\n\n    I\u2019ve enjoyed reading the anecdotes here of what people (who are probably diligent in practice as well as in consistency) have been able to do with dogs. I particular enjoyed reading about Garrett. I had a \u201cGarrett\u201d (Bear Doggie) at a time in my life once, a part wolf. I wonder if Sam\u2019s Garrett might have a bit of wolf in him, being a reservation dog and all. Sometimes I thought my Bear Doggie could just read my mind, like my cat does, but in reality I\u2019m sure, like Garrett, he was just a gift.\n\n  26. Kat says\n\n    This is fascinating and since I read your blog this morning I\u2019ve been experimenting with Ranger. I put two of his toys on his bed and asked him to get one by name. He grabbed the other one and played with it enthusiastically. I should mention that both were toys we hadn\u2019t played with in months. I took the one he\u2019d grabbed saying \u201cgive, tiger cat\u201d and put it back on the bed. I put him in a down stay and put another toy, one that had been a great favorite months ago, on his bed with the tiger cat toy. I asked him to get booda and he didn\u2019t move but looked puzzled which is when I remembered that we\u2019d been in the habit of calling that particular toy booda booda. I asked him to find booda booda and he ran over and put his nose on it then grabbed the tiger cat and played with it tossing it up and down. I can\u2019t say I didn\u2019t indicate the booda toy with my eyes but he clearly understood I meant one toy over the other. I think that Ranger does recognize nouns as naming objects. He certainly recognizes nouns that name people. When he asks for a walk and someone else is going to take him I can say \u201cAlexandra will take you\u201d and he\u2019ll go looking for my daughter or \u201cDad will take you\u201d and he\u2019ll switch his attention to my husband. I\u2019m not sure I entirely grasp the distinction between noun as object and noun as action. If he can select the named object I\u2019d argue that he knows that noun in some context. I\u2019m not sure how to tell whether that understanding is comparable to mine\u2013a symbolic sound representation/label for a specific object\u2013or whether he is associating the sound label with an action that involves that object. I do know that his life is enriched by these discussions as they prompt me to experiment and try things to see what he can do, what he can learn and what he\u2019s able to understand.\n\n  27. Beth says\n\n    Growing up, I had a very smart Chesapeake Bay Retriever, who would do anything to have you throw a tennis ball for him. I could ask him to get his ball (i.e. tennis) , another ball (i.e another tennis ball), a hard ball, a soft ball or a football. He knew the names of all of them. The softball and football were a bit big to fit in his mouth, but he would do his best to bring them to me. He keep many of his toys outside in a manzanita bush, where he kept all of his precious possessions, but sometimes they were left around the yard. I never really knew where they were, so I couldn\u2019t be giving him clues about what to bring.\n\n    He also would go and get the newspaper for us each morning. He would run to the top of our very steep driveway and bring it into the house. (If our paper was missing, he would take the neighbor\u2019s!) I suspect that some dogs associate \u201cGo Get XXX\u201d with a what is typically gotten at that time of day or other specific situation. We usually didn\u2019t play ball first thing in the morning. But, I believe he understood both nouns and actions. He also knew go for walk, go for ride or go for a swim.\n\n    I also taught him hand signals. He would back up or move to the right or left and come forward (all the while facing me). So he could move in the shape of a square with out me saying anything. I was just 14 when we got him and really didn\u2019t know much about training, but he was very food and ball motivated and easy to train.\n\n    Now I have 2 cats and the only word I am really sure they understand is \u2018birdies\u2019. They are pretty smart (almost telepathic about many things). I have clicker trained them to respond to hand signals, but I am convinced they are unable to differentiate between words, even between their own names. Intonation of words is really all they get verbally. It\u2019s really worse than the old Far Side Cartoon \u201cBlah Blah Blah Ginger\u201d.\n\n    I think many of us are fascinated by what animals understand and feel. Understanding the differences in what and how they learn helps us create a better life for them.\n\n  28. Debra says\n\n    I had to laugh at your description of Willie when you tried to get him to bring toys by names. I had watched the same show and immediately tried to get my dog to bring me toys by name. Of course my expectations were way too high and he became confused and just tried to bring me toys randomly. I later noticed in the yard that he knows toys in a different context. There I have always asked him to interact with toys by name \u2013 a frisbee, a stick, and a ball. I was more disciplined about using a clicker when I was training outside and I wonder if that made a difference. (In the house I was more casual \u2013 in the yard I would have to walk farther if I couldn\u2019t get him to bring the toy I wanted!).\n\n    I love the pictures of Willie playing with his friend. Recently my younger aussie has found a new lab mix friend to play with in our corral. She funs as fast as him and I think it\u2019s the same thing as you describe \u2013 she keeps up or passes him and he can\u2019t do his usual herding turning or nipping trick. It was so funny to watch the first time he realized she was keeping up (or passing him). Total look of confusion as he had to readjust his thinking.\n\n  29. Dobe mom says\n\n    Interesting question. I\u2019d say my doberman does know certain objects. He can find several of his toys by name. We are training in competitive obedience so for example in our last class, we were working on scent articles and the instructor put toys in the pile of unscented articles as a twist on the exercise. He seemed to understand I wanted the scented article, not the toy or the other articles. When we are training at home I can put him in the bedroom, hide his dumb bell in the living room and then send him to find it\u2026.he knows I don\u2019t want the ball or the rope toy or his bone that are also lying around. I do use different words if I want him to retrieve his dumb bell vs. his scent article vs. his ball when we are playing.\n\n    My former doberman surprised me one day\u2026.I had put his collar on the nightstand the night before and then forgot about it. When I was going to take him for a walk the next day, I was looking for it and said something to him about where I did I put his collar??? He ran in the bedroom and got it and brought it to me. I had no idea he knew what his collar was\u2026..had never tried to teach him that word before.\n\n  30. says\n\n    My quadriplegic brother used to have a service dog, Marilyn, a blonde Great Dane, who could go get items whose names she knew and take them to specific people she knew. Once he asked her to go back to his van, get my purse and bring it to me. She knew \u201cpurse\u201d was an unfamiliar object and selected it, and I was an unfamiliar person (not him or his wife) so she brought it to me\u2013except she picked it up by the bottom and we had to go back to the van to get all the items that had fallen out on the way! Still, I was impressed.\n\n    She was also trained to run around behind him at a curb cut and jump up, pushing him with all four paws on his back until he was up on the curb. They used to stop pedestrian traffic in the city as people watched this process.\n\n    I have tried to teach my dogs to distinguish objects since then, but without the same success.\n\n    Sadly, Marilyn didn\u2019t live long\u20138 years\u2013but we have great memories.\n\n  31. says\n\n    I have a dog I rescued from a trash container. I have him for 3 years now, and I taught him basic stuff like sitting, down and staying\u2026 except he doesn\u2019t like staying much hehe\u2026 I like how simply calling his name he starts swirling his tail around.\n\n  32. Frances says\n\n    Very, very interesting discussion \u2013 I wonder if associating different actions or games with different toys might speed up learning the names? The noun versus verb thing could explain why I have struggled to get mine to differentiate \u2013 they know the difference between fetch it games, and find it games, but I have tended to use the same toys for both. I think I will experiment with different sets of toys for different activities, and see if they leafn more easily.\n\n  33. Anna says\n\n    I had not really thought about it until this blog came up but my dogs, even at their young ages, know quite a few words. How exactly the words work in their brain I don\u2019t know. My14 month old Rudy knows \u201cWhere is ______?\u201d Grammy, Mommy, Pattie (the cat), Penny etc. by looking at them if they are in sight or going to see where they are if not. However unthinking human that I am I sometimes ask \u201cWhere is Penny?\u201d but at other times ask \u201cWhere is your sister?\u201d referring to his corgi sister Penny and both statements invokes the same response toward Penny so two words represents the same thing to him. Then poor Penny if she is not in sight he goes, finds her, grabs her neck and drags her back to me\u2026 she is the only \u201cthing\u201d he ever fetches. Then again if he ever fetched his 84 year old Grammy he would be in BIG trouble so maybe he is smart enough to know that too.\n\n  34. Ann W in PA says\n\n    Interesting! I came up with a list of 55 cues Rowdy knows\u2026 while some are object names, each cue involves him interacting with the object in some specific way (jump through the tire, go collect dollars from people) and thinking it over with this new perspective, I\u2019m sure he is perceiving those cues as me asking him to DO something. I generally always ask him to do the same thing with each object. He does seem to know some words that are sort of amplifiers, like \u2018more\u2019 and \u2018farther,\u2019 but those took longer for him to get, and I\u2019m unsure of what they really mean to him, only that they elicit what it is I\u2019m wanting at the time.\n\n    Somewhat related\u2026 I\u2019m teaching a clicker class for the first time, and it has been so interesting how differently each dog learns. One of the goals of class is to get the dogs to be more creative in trying to figure out what the person wants them to do, and just build the learning relationship, so we\u2019ve been playing shaping games. Some of the \u201ctricks\u201d we\u2019ve been shaping fall into different categories: interacting with an object (like 101 things to do with a box), interact with a person (targeting nose-to-hand), interacting with a place or area (like go to a mat or place marked on the floor), moving a body part (shake your head). I expected the dogs to just be more savvy or less savvy at learning, but it is so interesting that different dogs find some of the concepts way more difficult to understand than others, and have a hard time grasping what this new game is, when they are very savvy with the other \u2018categories.\u2019 My Rowdy had a hard time with body movements, and it was absolutely hilarious teaching him to move his head \u2013 I had to break it down to teeeeeny steps and have good timing since he was prone to choose some other behavior he was doing at the same time as the \u2018thing I was looking for\u2019 \u2013 thus far the result is a sort of Parkinsons-esque movement, but at least he\u2019s getting that sometimes our games might involve him moving a part of his body around. One dog, who immediately grasped all the other games, at first just did not recognize the concept that the criteria might have something to do with being near a specific place on the floor. It seems like with shaping, you get to observe more closely just how the dog is sorting out the task on his own, since you\u2019re giving less help than using a different method like luring, where all of the dogs have performed almost identically (like training the target stick, and then using it to teach them to spin.) But definitely, once the dog worked through a \u2018category\u2019 once, he was better able to understand a similar game later. I can\u2019t tell if they actually are learning concepts, to pay attention to aspects of their environment they previously ignored, or if they are just adding to their mental list of \u2018things that might be good guesses,\u2019 but they definitely each came to class with a unique way of looking at a problem.\n\n  35. says\n\n    I loved the BBC program for lots of reasons. Facinating!\n\n    About words\n    I\u2019ve tried (not persistently) to teach my dogs over time the difference between their toys with little success. I think it\u2019s more a lack of my consistent persistence, than their inability to learn. My own lack of understanding about training, and impatience with the task, certainly played a part.\n\n    About actions\n    I\u2019ve clicker trained my current guide dog to understand how to do certain things, like; show me elevator buttons, show me security card readers and automatic door openers, point to door handles, and find chairs. She\u2019s a quick study and loves the clicker game.\n\n    At the peak of our training exercises, I noticed we were inadvertently putting a chain of behaviors together, and I pondered how she thought about the words and actions she was learning. To me it became clear that as we entered my workplace, finding the elevator button, then finding the security card reader and pointing to the door handle were a short chain of behaviors, that though separate, behaviors, all lead to getting us to a certain destination.\n\n    It sseems to me, that as you said Trisha, over time different dogs seem to have a different facility for learning words.\n\n    The thing that was most facinating to me about the program, was the emphasis on the thousands, or possibly hundreds of thousands of years of bonding and domestication that have created a unique cooperative relationship between canine and human, and the impact that unique relationship has had on each species.\n\n    I deeply value the learning I\u2019ve experienced through clicker training, behaviorism in general, and ethology, yet I\u2019ve felt there\u2019s an aspect missing in each of those disiplins that doesn\u2019t take into account the experience I\u2019ve had with each of my guide dogs.\n\n    There is a level of understanding that develops over time that comes from spending 24 hours a day, seven days a week together, in all kinds of situations.\n\n    There is an interdependence that is deeply engrained in the relationship.\n\n    Because blind handlers don\u2019t have all the information they may need in a certain situation, and their dog often has more information than they do, there is a silent communication that develops over time between dog and handler.\n\n    While guide dogs are taught to do many things, there are also certain behaviors, that because of their work, they are prohibbited from doing. That training in inhibiting some behaviors, spills over into their lives in other ways. An example is a friend\u2019s guide was asked by her companion to pick up a frisby and carry it outside. Guides are taught not to take objects out of their homes, because the blind handler may not see that they have something in their mouths. The companion thought the dog was stupid, because another dog he knew could do this \u201csimple,\u201d behavior. He wasn\u2019t taking into account the training of the dog, and why that training inhibited the dog from performing the behavior.\n\n    A question that behaviorists have given me pause to think about, is how much of what we teach a dog inhibits them from doing things they might otherwise think to do on their own?\n\n    With guides, we teach them to think and problem solve, but only under certain circumstances. A dog that is too \u201cbusy,\u201d or thinks too much, may not be well suited for the work. Being still and quiet is an important part of the job as well.\n\n    Thanks for turning us on to this program!\n\n  36. says\n\n    My little dog is quite intelligent, I think. She learns quickly, reasons well and is generally pretty quick on the uptake. That said, she is not terrific with verbal labels. Much better at following my \u201ceyes pointing,\u201d hand gestures etc. I haven\u2019t really worked with her too much on labels \u2026 but she doesn\u2019t seem to get \u201cfind Bruce\u201d or \u201cfind Carolyn\u201d although she certainly understands exactly \u201cfind it\u201d which refers to a treat. I\u2019ve been working with her on Left and Right recently, trying to give minimal visual cues and concentrate on verbal. She\u2019s making progress but I wouldn\u2019t say she\u2019s quick on this one.\n\n  37. DebC says\n\n    This is all very fascinating \u2013 I love hearing about other\u2019s experiences with their dogs. I think that Bo (border collie) does have some concept of words \u2013 at least I thought he did. Now I am not as positive because is it the words or the action? I still think he has some words\u2026.if I tell him to \u201cgo find (insert name)\u201d he does actually go find that person. If I say \u201cgo get your chicken (or ball)\u201d he does come back with that item. But if I say \u201ctime for bed\u201d is he going to his crate because it\u2019s bed time, or that \u2018bed\u2019 means go to your crate = get a biscuit? One big difference between Bo and Dozer (Lab mix): if I point at an item Bo will look in the direction I am pointing, Dozer will look at my finger/hand.\n\n  38. Jane says\n\n    I\u2019ve recently been discovering that the capacity to learn a lot of words does not necessarily track with the dog\u2019s overall intelligence, or at least intelligence in different areas besides language. My previous dog, a Lab/husky mix, was a poor problem solver in general and took a bit longer than average to learn new tricks, but had an immense vocabulary, many of the words picked up \u201caccidently\u201d (like when you suddenly realize one day that they react mightily when you say \u201ctoast\u201d or \u201cpopcorn\u201d, without ever having meant to teach them this). She truly was one of those dogs in whose presence you found yourself spelling things, rather than saying the full word. Yet this same dog could not in twelve years figure out how to get out of a room by pushing on the door that was merely ajar, and not closed.\n\n    In contrast, my new dogs (both rescued cattle dogs) learn tricks lightning-fast, and have quickly solved every food puzzle toy I\u2019ve ever put in front of them, but I\u2019d be surprised if they\u2019ve learned more than about fifteen or twenty words in the year I\u2019ve had them. It still shocks me a bit. I really think they are incredibly attuned to subtle body movements and the overall tone of my voice, rather than the specific words, and that this is how they learn. I did try to teach one of them specific toy words, and I think you\u2019re on to something with the \u201ccall to action\u201d rather than \u201clabel\u201d idea\u2013every request to \u201cget your XXX\u201d was met with an enthusiastic leap toward whichever toy he preferred at that moment, which usually was not the one requested.\n\n  39. says\n\n    Interesting post and very provocative comments here. Makes me think a lot about how Puzzle and I interact at home and in the field and the sense she seems to make of words that might be different than the sense *I* think she makes of them.\n\n    \u201cFind\u201d \u2014 that verb she loves, she understands is associated with human scent located all the way to its source. She also understand that, when presented with a scent article, \u201cFind THAT\u201d means ignore every other human scent and find only the one in the scent article. She does seem to understand that THAT can change from day-to-day, search to search, and that the whole sequence is about taking a good wuff of the scent article, memorizing its signature, and then locating that scent again in a host of others.\n\n    At this point Puz can select some toys by name when I ask her to, but not all of them, and this specificity seems to have come to her with more difficulty than search commands. Certainly, we\u2019ve worked much less at this! \u201cPink ball\u201d she gets \u2014 but she may struggle to differentiate between the fuzzy octopus (Pooz-a-pus) and the fuzzy snake (Sneaky Snake), both of which have similar textures are long. Plush Leo she has learned \u2014 it\u2019s her favorite toy of all, and she knows when I croon \u201cGo get Leeeeee\u2014ooohhhhhh\u201d what to bring back, including all the bits that go inside.\n\n    She knows \u201cWhere\u2019s \u2026?\u201d means we\u2019re looking for something. She has begun to find the other dogs or cats in the house by name \u2014 some more easily than others, which suggests they have some marked significance for her I don\u2019t recognize? knows them better? likes them better? \u2014 but her finds of them aren\u2019t with the consistency we see in the search field finding a human.\n\n    Puz does know some sign language. All the basic commands \u2014 sit, stand, lie down, wait \u2014 but she also knows \u201cready to go?\u201d and \u201cgood girl, pretty girl\u201d and \u201cI love you.\u201d The first time she smiled and wagged when I signed good girl and pretty girl and I love you in the same way she smiles and wags when I say it, I was thrilled. That said, I know 50% or more of that message is carried in my body language, which is probably identical in both instances. Heck, maybe there\u2019s just a twitch of endorphin when I say it or sign it, and she smells the I love you rather than sees it.\n\n    I love the peeks and maybes such questions raise.\n\n    A very interesting thread!\n\n  40. Rebecca says\n\n    My dog Maddie knows,\u201dGo find Cleo.\u201d as a cue to find one of the cats who needs daily medication, but would prefer to skip said medication. However, if Maddie is in a room that does not contain Cleo, she will show me where any other cat in the room is located. Which is sort of weird, since she differentiates if Cleo is in the room. Somehow, she has generalized find Cleo=action involving alerting on a cat, even though I never reinforce her for finding the other cats.\n\n    Maybe annoying cats is self reinforcing for her, and hope springs eternal. Though about every 10th time, she will run out of the room and entice Cleo to chase her back to where I am (they are buddies). I haven\u2019t figured out what the difference is in the two scenarios, except maybe whether or not Maddie knows exactly where Cleo happens to be at that specific time.\n\n  41. says\n\n    A busy mind keeps one out of trouble!\n\n    Very interesting. I\u2019ll have to do some testing at home. Off the top of my head.\n\n    I find the males in my home are more action driven: Pug, Auzzie, Beagle where as my female beagle LOVES to learn specifics along with actions. She\u2019s a brainiac.\n\n    I wondered about that a while ago when watching THEM try to communicate with ME ;\n\n    ie\u2026they want me to pick something up like a ball, tug toy or some food that they can\u2019t get to (I play hide popcorn), they look, sit, point with paw or bark once until I figure out what it is they want. If all the toys are in a pile, the boys will wait until I pick up the one he feels like playing with\u2026\n\n    Using their , body language for actions or states of mind/emotions\u2026I can\u2019t think of any way they use either to \u201clabel\u201d something FOR me to discriminate.\n\n    Maybe that\u2019s why some of my dogs look to me like they don\u2019t see the point of learning something specific, we already have a communication in place that works just fine :)\n\n  42. Kim says\n\n    My eldest dog has a heck of a vocabulary. I used to think that she was learning more of how things were said and less of what was said, but I did some proofing both with myself and others saying things in several different tones and her reactions were largly the same.\n\n    So far she knows several toys by name (\u201cget your\u201d rope, ball, ring, frizbee and bear (all fuzzy things are \u201cbears\u201d)), bath (she hates them), hungry, thirsty, outside, potty, walk, bone (chewing time!), bye bye (car ride), bed, out (get out of the room), move (get out of my way), find it or find + toy name, not to mention all the trick, agility and obedience words (plus the \u201csign language\u201d) she knows too.\n\n    But funny enough, she doesn\u2019t seem to attribute names to living things\u2026with the exception of a very unusual cat I had for 9 years. She knew Foley alright, because he make sure she did ;) However, I\u2019m the only living thing in this world that matters to her. The current cats and my other dog are definately not intentially on her radar!\n\n\n  43. says\n\n    My BC Fenway is very vocal. The whines and barks are clearly his signals to me that he wants me to take action: throw the ball, I need to pee or I\u2019m hungry. That\u2019s simple and not at all remarkable.\n\n    But there are times when he yodels at me. These are connected with happy play. I\u2019ve begun to yodel back to him and we\u2019ve been having \u201cconversations\u201d. He seems utterly delighted that I am talking \u201cdog\u201d to him. During these times he seems to stop wanting something and is just interested in sharing some talk. I\u2019m thrilled at this development because it seems to me our bond is getting even tighter, if that\u2019s possible!\n\n    My former BC used to do some groaning (that\u2019s the best way I can describe it) while he was getting cozy in bed. I would mimic his sounds and we would do a duet that could last for minutes, and get softer and softer until he drifted off to sleep. If I changed my pitch\n\n  44. Kerry L. says\n\n    Most interesting ideas. I would say that Walter associates my words with actions or the anticipation of actions. Sit, down, out, supper, ride, ready?, etc. I\u2019ve deliberately avoided using words like treat and cookie just to avoid his over-exuberant reactions.\n\n  45. lin says\n\n    Old Pup seems to know actions much more than nouns, and body language and tone much more than words. She\u2019s not interested in toys, and though she does seem to know my husband and me by name, when he tells her, \u201cFind Lin,\u201d if I\u2019m walking with them, Old Pup doesn\u2019t seem to know what to do. So she probably associates \u201cFind Lin\u201d with a hide and seek game.\n\n    I wonder if, because scent is so important to dogs, that they could learn nouns better if they were associated by scent. If, say, each of their toys or objects were dabbed with a different perfume, and we gave them a scent strip and told them, \u201cFind\u201d\n\n  46. Katie says\n\n    When people ask me how many signs/cues my puppy knows I never consider half of them when I answer. I, too, finally took the time to sit and write them all down. One in particular caught my interest. Lily is only four months old and recently figured out how fun it is to grab the end of the toilet paper roll and run around the apartment until she reaches the couch. As cute as this looks in the movies, it\u2019s definitely not cute after the first time. (Well, it kind of still is but I\u2019m not about to tell her that.) Eventually I taught her \u201cout,\u201d which basically is the cue to walk out of the bathroom and not come back in. I never used it in any other context but started to wonder if I could. At four months and one week it definitely works! Just for fun I tried it from the kitchen and with no hand cues or body blocks she walked out and sat in the living room. Lily\u2019s repeated this behavior in different rooms and different homes. I\u2019m continually amazed by how smart she is!\n\n  47. says\n\n    This article really got me thinking about what my dogs understand. I would say mine primarily know things by the action and not the item. I think this is because it\u2019s what I have taught them from pups or when they first became part of our family. Now I am going to have to observe mine and see what they react to more.\n\n  48. Susanna says\n\n    Great article, really anjoyed reading about how your BC play and herding gets mixed together, since my BC is exactly the same. Runs like mad and then \u2018attacks\u2019 the other dog and when they stop he tries to get them to run again. My terrier is so sick of him but is not \u2018strong\u2019 enough to tell him off perperly to stop him doing it\n\n  49. Mihaela says\n\n    I am thinking that dogs normally (i.e without the two-leggeds around) do not use vocalizations to identify objects. It may be that smell, taste, texture or a combination, are the equivalents of words in their minds for that purpose. So it\u2019s very likely that they don\u2019t really regard the words we say as labels for those objects. It might be more like \u201cwhen the two-legged makes a group of sounds including \u2018ball\u2019, I have to DO something about \u2018the ball\u2019: run to it, touch it, fetch it etc\u201d. On the other hand, even at this level, they may have the capacity to generalize (much like we do when we transform words into notions). Otherwise, how would they know, for instance, that we mean \u2018ball\u2019 for a small round evenly colored thing tasting of rubber (i.e small rubber ball), as much as for a larger round patterned thing with rough texture (i.e tennis ball)?\n    Sorry, Trisha, this is what happens when you have a blog: you have to read through stuff like this and act interested\u2026\n\n  50. says\n\n    A little late in response, but I think there is a lot of variation in dogs as to whether they understand words as relating to objects or actions. I believe the variation to be essentially innate, and not directly related to the intelligence of the individual dog.\n\n    My oldest Staffordshire Bull Terrier, Elmo, came to me as an adult dog (almost 4) with very little training. I trained and competed with him in obedience and agility. He certainly understood words as relating to actions, but I sometimes ran into trouble training him because he had a different understanding of a particular word or phrase than I expected. For instance, when I went to teach him the directed retrieve for Utility, I could not get him to retrieve the glove. Which made no sense, he loved to retrieve, and had no hesitation about carrying around any object. Finally one day I tossed down the glove and said \u201ctake it!\u201d and he went over to the piano and looked very deliberately towards the top, where his dumbbell was stored out of reach. I don\u2019t know how much more clear he could have made it that \u201ctake it\u201d to him meant the dumbbell! So I tossed the glove again, and said \u201cglove!\u201d (a new word to him), and he happily retrieved it. He would retrieve it on any command EXCEPT \u201ctake it\u201d.\n\n    Now I\u2019m working with a bitch of the same breed, a few years younger, and I\u2019ve had her and trained her from 13 weeks of age. I think she might know what \u201cball\u201d means, though to her, that would only apply to a tennis ball, since that\u2019s the only toy she has any interest in. Beyond that, I don\u2019t think any words relate to objects in her mind, while she knows many commands, they all relate to actions. She\u2019s a brilliant dog, one of the best canine problem solvers I\u2019ve ever encountered, and she understands a lot of phrases I never actually tried to teach her, but they only relate to actions.\n\n    So, 2 dogs, same breed, trained by the same person, but with very different understandings of words. And the one who relates words to objects the best is the dog that had little early mental stimulation. To me, that says it\u2019s an innate variation.\n\n  51. Michelle says\n\n    I recall one evening when my shepherd-collie mix Sophie was about three years old. Unbeknownst to Sophie, I was planning to leave her at the kennel the next day and so had no intentions of giving her a bath, even though she was smelling a bit doggy. As I was petting her, I observed, \u201cP.U. You stink!\u201d Sophie looked at me, sighed, and obediently took herself into the shower for a bath. I had never intentionally taught her this, but I guess she\u2019d heard \u201cP.U. You stink!\u201d before I got out the towels and dog shampoo enough to act on the verbal cue.\n\n  52. Deanna in OR says\n\n    Regarding dogs interpreting written or drawn symbols as having meaning or as cues\u2013\n    A couple of years ago, a newsletter from the Assistance Dog Institute (now Bergen University of Canine Studies) had an article about how they taught several of their service-dogs-in-training to respond to big \u201cflash cards\u201d with either symbols or simple written words as cues for behaviors They apparently could distinguish between several different cues, all on the same large white card stock. It was fascinating. One of these days I might try this with my collie and my BC.\n\n    My collie, Willow, is really good with \u201cRight\u201d and \u201cLeft\u201d in agility\u2013sometimes when I get mixed up and say \u201cjump right\u201d while my body is screaming \u201cjump left\u201d, she\u2019ll start to change leads to the right and then realize, no, she really meant left and save my run\u2013while barking at me to Pay Attention, mom!\n\n  53. Mary says\n\n    I, too, have a border collie that seemed confused when I tried to teach him the names of toys, and I ALSO came to the conclusion that he thought the word was a command for action. After all, most of the words I say to him have an action associated with it. \u201cUpstairs\u201d means to go upstairs. \u201cOutside\u201d means to go outside. \u201cPotty\u201d means to urinate or defecate. And when we\u2019re doing agility, \u201cjump\u201d means to go over a bar. \u201cTunnel\u201d means to run through the tunnel. And when herding, \u201ccome bye\u201d means to run clockwise, etc. I\u2019m happy that someone else came to the same conclusion I did!\n\n  54. Steve B says\n\n    Well, I don\u2019t have an answer, but my experience is my last dog could distinguish between 8 different toys. The game became \u201cgo get toy X,\u201d which he would bring and then wait for me to tell him to get something else. But it started with him bringing me a toy and my saying \u201cGood X!\u201d as we played with each toy in turn.\n\n    Watching my daughter\u2019s language develop, I think it could be argued that people also start out interpreting words as action, but learn to associate them with an object. I\u2019d like to believe that after a time, Talbot (who, by the way, was a Brittany/English Setter/(I think) Collie) made the transition to understanding \u201cball\u201d or \u201ctug\u201d or \u201cbone\u201d or X did mean the object and not an action, but obviously I can\u2019t say for sure.\n\n  55. says\n\n    Is it possible that since Willie\u2019s life and training is oriented around action and cues as would be expected from a herder, that action-based brain development was dominant for him? I\u2019ve had a Dane who seemed to easily distinguish over 200 nouns and verbs, and he was a typical Dane, not to0 action oriented.\n    In fact most all of my danes seemed to have no trouble between a noun and a verb, unless I just didn\u2019t really understand how I was communicating with them. And were awfully good self-initiating problem solvers.\n    But Danes aren\u2019t known for a high level of action oriented and human orchestrated activities. And these guys didn\u2019t really have any \u201cformal\u201d training to learn words, they just seemed to on their own via hanging around me. Companions like the dog that learned so many words in the BBC show.\n    I don\u2019t know, you\u2019ve just got me wondering if dog\u2019s brains develop or don\u2019t develop word/grammar recognitions according to their lifestyle and training purposes?\n\n  56. trisha says\n\n    I think that might be the exact issue: not only were all of Willie\u2019s cues action oriented, but he is 100 % an action oriented dog. Not a \u2018thinker\u2019 at all\u2026 I have to work hard on stopping him from anticipating. One of my cues to him has become (almost inadvertently) \u201cTake a breath.\u201d Good observation from Great Dane Service Dog.\n\nLeave a Reply\n\n"}

El Diario also provided a primer on songs to sing during the parade, and some helpful YouTube videos to practice your dance moves to.\n\nEl Diario also ran a sobering editorial on the situation of Puerto Rican teenagers in New York City:\n\nThis week, the Community Service Society (CSS) shared with the media figures updated from a 2010 report, which warned that Puerto Ricans between 14 and 16 are behind in education and employment. New statistics show that the situation worsened in the two years following the publication of the study.\n\nThe numbers are discouraging: 30 percent of the 100,000 young Puerto Ricans living in the five boroughs in 2009 and 2010 reported not going to work or school.\n\nThe editorial called for more funding for schools, community organizations, GED and job placement programs in Puerto Rican neighborhoods:\n\nWhen compared with other Latino groups, the Puerto Rican community has more members living at the extremes: more people reporting incomes below the federal poverty line, but also more people reporting high levels of income. This division can also be seen in neighborhoods. Poor Puerto Ricans \u2014 unlike Dominicans and Mexicans who tend to be more mixed \u2014 are surrounded by other poor Puerto Ricans. With high concentrations of poverty, intervention is needed to break this cycle.\n\nAn image of the Daily News' erroneous promotion for the Puerto Rican Day Parade. (Via El Diario)\n\nEl Diario and many other outlets also had some fun with a snafu at the Daily News, which mistakenly printed the Cuban flag instead of the Puerto Rican flag in a full-page advertisement for the parade:\n\nAlthough Cuba and Puerto Rico are two wings of a bird, as the famous poem of the Puerto Rican Lola Rodriguez de Tio, there are large differences between the two countries. As between the two flags.\n\nThe website Latino Rebels broke the story, and the Daily News yesterday put out the following apology on Facebook and by email:\n\nThe Daily News today erroneously printed the incorrect flag in a promotion for the 2012 National Puerto Rican Day Parade. As the presenting media sponsor, the Daily News apologizes to the Puerto Rican, Cuban and other Latino communities as well as parade sponsors who were offended by our mistake. It will be rectified in Friday\u2019s paper.\n\nHuffington Post pointed out that the error came at a particularly inopportune time:\n\nThe unfortunate mix-up actually comes a few weeks after a handful of Latino journalists were let go from the company as the Daily News\u2018 Spanish-language publication, Hora Hispana, was phased out. Journalist Maite Junco, editor Rodolfo Quebleen, and sales representative Jose Santiago were all let go when the Daily News pulled the plug on Hora Hispana, according to\n\nEl Diario offered some parting words of advice to readers:\n\nIf you have any further questions, do not be afraid to consult with El Diario / La Prensa, the oldest Spanish-language media in all the United States with nearly 100 years as the voice of the Hispanic community. And this Sunday do not miss our special supplement on the presence and influence in New York of the children of the Island of Enchantment.\n\n  \u2022 Alberto O.

It's one of those unusual ideas that just should not have worked - a retired sketch comedian, part of a now mythic broadcast classic, stepping into shoes no one knew he owed (or enjoyed). But not only did he succeed, he practically reinventing the reality genre. Now, some seven series later, Palin has traversed the globe, gone from one end of the planet to the other, explored the Sahara and the Himalayans, and followed in the footsteps of Hemingway and traversed a post-millennial New European. One of his most unusual journeys consisted to circumnavigating the Pacific Rim, going Full Circle around the Earth, if you will. Now finally available in a Region 1 release from the BBC, this brilliant showcase suggests no one does the seemingly impossible better than this personable ex-Python.\n\nThe Plot:\nPackaged onto three discs, the ten 50 minute installments that make up this series are jam-packed with all kinds of visual and locational pleasures. Specifically, we are treated to the following countries and adventures:\n\nEpisode One: Alaska/Russia:\nPalin begins in the Inuit town of Little Diomede Island, Alaska before heading across the Baring Straits and into Russia. There, he visits an active volcano, and an old Soviet gulag.\n\nEpisode Two: Japan/Korea\nWhile in the Asian island nation, Palin meets up with his Number One Japanese fan. She shows him the sights, while a trip to South Korea ends at the daunting DMZ.\n\nEpisode Three: China\nHaving visited the country many times before, Palin picks out unusual points of reference, including a trek to the Three Gorges Dam, and a visit with the isolated Miao peoples.\n\nEpisode Four: Vietnam/Philippines\nWhile in Hanoi, he takes in a cricket match. In Saigon, he checks out the Forbidden Purple Kingdom. In the Philippines, it's all psychic surgery and cockfights.\n\nEpisode Five: Malaysia/Indonesia\nFirst on the schedule is a journey to a Malaysian orangutan sanctuary, followed by a powwow with the Iban - until recently practicing headhunters. Later, he climbs Mt. Bromo and gets stranded in Java.\n\nEpisode Six: Australia/New Zealand\nDownunder ends up being a series of animal sanctuaries, Outback adventures, and a soap opera cameo. In the land of the Kiwis, it's a combination of Maoris and outdoor activities.\n\nEpisode Seven: Chile/Bolivia\nBeginning at Cape Horn, Palin makes his way up South America. Along the way he visits an island once associated with witches, a memorial for victims of the 1973 coup, and a copper mine.\n\nEpisode Eight: Bolivia/Peru\nMany famed locations are part of this stop: Lake Titicaca; Machu Picchu, and Palin's favorite place in all the world, the Pongo de Mainique canyon.\n\nEpisode Nine: Peru/Columbia\nAmong the many festivals he finds, Palin ends up watching an inter-village football match. After traversing part of the Amazon, he winds up in Bogot\u00e1, the most violent capital in the Western Hemisphere.\n\nEpisode Ten: Mexico/Western USA/Canada/Alaska\nIn Mexico, it's a lucha libre showcase. In America, it's a trip through a smog filled LA and San Francisco's Castro District. In Canada, it's a logging carnival. And in Alaska, it's...\n\nThe DVD:\nBy this time in his travels, 52 year old Michael Palin had seen much of the globe. He had traversed the world in a literary record of 79 days (beating Phileas Fogg by a mere 24 hours) and plotted the planet pole to pole. But even after all these seemingly endless journeys, he had seen little of Asia and the Americas. It wasn't on purpose, but a matter of previous itinerary plotting. In order to fulfill his needs as an explorer, some sovereign limitations kept him clear of certain locales. What better way then to correct this problem than by traversing the entire Pacific Rim, from Russia around and down across Antarctica and back up to Alaska, all in a year's time. Thus began the epic adventure Full Circle, a 50K mile trek that would remind everyone who watched why Palin stands as a singular travel host. Inordinately curious, resoundingly humble, and capable of drawing the viewer into his own amazed frame of reference, he remains the original constituent of the Lonely Planet Club, one of the medium's few infallible guides.\n\nMuch of Full Circle will feel familiar, especially for anyone who followed Palin's previous excursions. Clearly, popularity plays a part in all his efforts, but there is also a real insight into the concept of travel and tourism. When he enters a region, Palin purposely tries to get the feel of the place, to remove the commercial aspect and go directly for the cultural. Whether it's a visit to a former prison camp or a local wrestling match, our host always strives to uncover the secret significances involved. He wants to be part of the proceedings, learning the local folksongs or participating in a state-sponsored stage production. Certainly, some of these events seem like stunts, purposefully arranged to show off Palin's primary function as an actor and comedian. But Full Circle, just like almost all his other worldwide outings, drops the stranger in a strange land conceit for something far more charming - an global gourmet drinking in the various geographical banquets the planet has to offer.\n\nAnd what amazing dishes they are this time around. Unlike a similar minded traveler like Tony Bourdain, Palin doesn't sample - he splurges. Installments Seven through Nine take him through some of the most amazing vistas ever captured on film. The southern most aspects of South America represent the Earth at its most primal, and pretty, and Full Circle showcases all of it. So are the portions filmed in New Zealand, though Peter Jackson's visit to Tolkein territory also proved this out. Elsewhere, Vietnam is welcomed into the world after decades as a closed off thorn in the US's side, while in Indonesia, he takes in a traditional shadow puppet show. Perhaps the best aspect of Full Circle is how therapeutic and relaxing it is. Most vacations are stressed out exercises in maximizing leisure while minimizing outside interference. The usual result is typically more anxiety than before the journey began. With Palin, even the problems seem passive, handled with a kind of evenhanded resolve by some one quite used to thinking on his feet. While the notion of watching the same man basically repeat the approach that earned him accolades before might sound dull, Full Circle is far from boring. It reminds you why, sometimes, reality TV is superior to its fictional counterpart.\n\nThe Video:\nThe 1.33:1 full screen image is excellent, if a little too made-for-television, if you understand such a 'medium shot' suggestion. Unlike later adventures which would take on a more anamorphic look (thanks to being filmed and presented in a 16x9 format), Full Circle constantly reminds you of its broadcast beginnings. Some of the camerawork is a bit wonky, and we do suffer through a few too many man on the street sequences. Still, this is an amazing travelogue from a visual standpoint, and the DVD does a good job of preserving said approach.\n\nThe Audio:\nSadly, the sound is no great shakes. It's just Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo delivered in the most mundane way possible. Everything is even and mired in the midrange, while Palin's conversations and voiceover narration are always crystal clear - and in the end, that's what's most important.\n\nThe Extras:\nPerhaps the best part of what is otherwise a stellar series is the wonderful added content provided for this set. All found on the final disc, we are treated to an insightful half hour interview with Palin in which he discusses the many problems faced by the production - none more crucial than the discovery of his wife's need for emergency surgery while on his way to Australia. Taking a few days off during his journey to be by her side, it's just one of many issues to come up during the trip. Even better are nearly 60 minutes of deleted scenes, each covering a specific country or set-up. One of the best bits comes at the end, when Palin sits down with fellow funnyman Eric Idle as the two share some specific Python memories over a few martinis. It brings the entire enterprise back to its BBC roots.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\nNothing beats crossing the continents from the comfort of your laziest lounge chair, and when you toss in the proverbial wit of Michael Palin, something like Full Circle can do little except succeed. While not as inherently compelling as Around the World in 80 Days, or global goal oriented as Pole to Pole, it's still an essentially flawless examination of the many competing cultures sharing the power and abundance of the Pacific. It deserves every facet of such a Highly Recommended rating, and just misses out on a DVD Talk Collector's Series score by the smallest of margins. Oddly enough, Full Circle would be followed up by one of Palin's few missteps, an otherwise unique look at the world of writer Ernest Hemingway which offered more shtick than scenery. But here is where the real adventurer lies - in his element, and completely (un)comfortable - exactly how we like it.\n\n\nPopular Reviews\n1.\u00a0Bram Stoker's Dracula Supreme Cinema Series\n2.\u00a0Mosquito: 20th Anniversary Edition\n3.\u00a0Cannon: The Complete Collection\n4.\u00a0Dirty Work\n5.\u00a0A Room with a View (Criterion Collection)\n6.\u00a0Christine\n7.\u00a0Hyde's Secret Nightmare\n8.\u00a0Entourage: The Movie\n9.\u00a0Cop Car\n10.\u00a0The Last Man on Earth: Season 1\n\nSponsored Links\nDVD Blowouts\nAlien [Blu-ray]\nBuy: $19.99 $9.99\nSponsored Links\nRelease List Reviews Shop Newsletter Forum DVD Giveaways Blu-Ray Advertise"}

If so, do I need to take a probiotic supplement or is the raw milk sufficient?\u00a0\n\nAnswer (Published 9/20/2011)\n\nDrinking raw milk appears to be gaining in popularity, but I'm not sure that it's a good idea. Proponents of raw milk make extravagant health claims for it - that it cures thyroid deficiency, asthma, and allergies, for example. Most of the claims are anecdotal and the scientific evidence for such benefits is sparse. Essentially, these ideas are based on two studies, one published in June 2006 in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology and the other in May 2007 in Clinical and Experimental Allergy. Both suggested that children who lived on farms and drank raw milk had fewer problems with asthma and hay fever than did kids drinking pasteurized milk.\n\nRelated Weil Products\n\nMilk is pasteurized for a reason - to kill the organisms that can otherwise cause such serious diseases as listeriosis, typhoid fever, tuberculosis, diphtheria and brucellosis. When they occur, these diseases are especially dangerous to pregnant women, children, the elderly and individuals with weakened immune systems.\u00a0 In pregnant women, listeriosis can cause miscarriage, fetal death or illness or death of newborns, even when the mother doesn't get sick.\u00a0\n\nProponents of raw milk claim that pasteurization reduces the nutritional content of milk. I know of no evidence that supports this. If you want to drink raw milk, make sure that it is from a grade A dairy and that the milk is tested frequently by state inspectors. Be aware, however, that in the United States, interstate sale of raw milk for human consumption is illegal and that more than 20 states ban it. (Elsewhere, raw milk can be sold under laws that vary from state to state.)\n\nI don't think probiotics would be protective against any disease-causing organisms in raw milk. I also suspect that lactose-intolerant individuals would find that raw milk is even less digestible than pasteurized milk.\n\nIf you're asking if I recommend raw milk over pasteurized milk, the answer is \"no.\" And I'm not a big proponent of drinking cow's milk in the first place. Most adults worldwide are lactose intolerant and can't digest the natural sugar in milk. Beyond that, the milk protein (casein) can irritate the immune system and stimulate mucus production, worsening allergy symptoms. This is why milk consumption is associated with recurrent childhood ear infections, eczema, chronic bronchitis, asthma, and sinus conditions. Even those who are not allergic to milk but have autoimmune diseases or digestive problems may find that their symptoms improve when they eliminate milk and milk products.\n\nAndrew Weil, M.D\n\nCreative Commons License Some Rights Reserved Creative Commons Copyright Notice\n\nThe Weil Vitamin Advisor\nGet your FREE personalized vitamin recommendation & supplement plan today!\n\nDr. Weil on Healthy Aging\n\nDr. Weil's Spontaneous Happiness\nAchieve emotional well-being\nin just eight weeks!\nStart your 10-day free trial now!\n\nVitamin Library\n\nDr. Weil's Optimum Health Plan\nYour 8-week plan to wellness.\nBegin your journey today!\n\nDr. Weil's Head-to-Toe\nWellness Guide\n\nYour guide to natural health.\nUse the Wellness Guide today!\n\nDr. Weil's Anti-Inflammatory Diet Food Pyramid\nOur interactive tool can help improve overall health through diet.\n\nCondition Care Guide\n\nHealthy Recipes\n\nQ&A Library\nOver 2,000 questions from you\nand their corresponding answers\nfrom Dr. Weil.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2014 Weil Lifestyle, LLC\n\nAd Choice\nAdvertising Notice\n"}

However, the stubborn engine begins to regret his short-sighted decision when he is called upon to pick up opera singer Alicia Botti, the Mayor of Sodor, and the Brass Band for an evening concert, but accidentally collects Farmer Trotter, Farmer McColl, and their animals instead.\n\nJames knows what must be done. Thomas and Edward collect the important passengers, whilst James hastily takes the farmers to the docks. He then quickly puffs back to the Town Hall and helps Thomas and Edward light up Alicia's concert. James could not feel prouder to have his beaming lamp.\n\n\n\n\n  \u2022 Going by production order, this is the third episode of the fourteenth season.\n  \u2022 In Germany, the episode is titled \"James is in the Dark\".\n  \u2022 The headlamp given to James is normally used on vintage cars of the early 1900s.\n\n\n  \u2022 It is against the rules for James to not have a lamp in the dark and his crew should have known this.\n  \u2022 Sir Topham says \"It'll be very dark tonight, you must have a lamp fitted\", but the engines should have lamps at night regardless of how dark it is.\n  \u2022 It is said that the worker tried to fit a lamp to James' boiler, but he actually tries to fit it to James' running board. Also, it is said that the worker tried to fit the lamp to his funnel, but he actually attempts to fit it on top of his smokebox, and when it is said that the lamp is tried on James' buffer, it is actually fitted to his lamp iron.\n  \u2022 Farmer McColl and Farmer Trotter should have known better than to board James' train with their animals.\n  \u2022 James should have recognised his friends' voices even if he did not see them.\n  \u2022 James should have been able to see more than he did.\n  \u2022 Cranky can be seen sleeping at the docks, but it has been said on at least a couple occasions that he never sleeps.\n  \u2022 There is no explanation as to why James is given an odd looking lamp.\n  \u2022 James acts as if this was his first time running at night. But he has done so many times before.\n  \u2022 Throughout the episode, the engine's fireboxes do not glow.\n  \u2022 Shining a lamp on Alicia Botti would have made no difference, as a spotlight was already on her. And she certainly would not have been seen for miles.\n  \u2022 For some reason, the station lamps at Maithwaite are not on.\n  \u2022 Farmer McColl has railway access at his farm, so there was no need for him to take his animals to the station.\n  \u2022 Brakevans should have been added to James, Henry, Rosie, and Diesel's trains.\n\n\n\nMerchandise Gallery\n\n\nAround Wikia's network\n\nRandom Wiki"}

Tangram puzzles are a great activity to challenge visual perceptual skills. Tangrams are also great for helping to develop motor planning skills, spatial relations, and eye hand coordination, and to top it off, they require a child to use problem-solving skills!

And this is the area where Nick lived and went to school.\"\n\nNull joined the Navy shortly after his graduation in 1989 from Parkersburg South High School, winning numerous honors including the bronze star.\n\nAnd now, two years after his death in a helicopter attack in Afghanistan, his name, his legacy and his sacrifice will be remembered for decades to come.\n\n\nUpdated: 8/22/2013 3:20 P.M.\n\nA fallen soldier from our area will get another honor Friday.\n\nChief Petty Officer Nick Null died two years ago during a helicopter crash in Afghanistan.\n\nAccording to Delegate Dan Poling's office, during the 2013 regular legislative session, the House of Delegates adopted House Concurrent Resolution 62, calling for what is currently known as DuPont Road Bridge to be named the Navy Chief Petty Officer Nicholas Heath Null Memorial Bridge.\n\nFriday morning, the overpass at route 50 at West Virginia route 68 will be named in his honor. The ceremony begins at 11 A.M.\n\nThe West Virginia Division of Highways says the westbound entrance ramp to route 68 will be closed from 10 A.M. to noon while the ceremony is going on.\n\nThe remaining ramps at the interchange will remain open, but the d-o-h says to expect minor traffic delays.\n\n\nThe memorial to honor a Navy Seal killed in combat is getting closer.\nNick Null's family couldn't be prouder.\n\nNick's stepdad Alan Litman says the community is very supportive of the memorial.\n\nAs a big veteran town, his mom Tracy wanted the memorial not just to honor her fallen son, but all the soldiers in the valley.\n\nAlan says that epitomizes who Nick was; he didn't want things to be about him.\n\n\u201cIt's been a dream of my wife Tracy\u2019s ever since Nick got killed that she wanted to do something to honor Nick,\u201d Litman says. \u201cFor us to actually be digging the dirt out and putting a stone back in, getting ready for the concrete -- it was pretty emotional at the house this morning.\u201d\n\nThe memorial will be dedicated August 3, the same day of the Nick Null 5K Race.\n\nA guest speaker is coming in from Virginia, and a well-known artist from the Fallen Soldier Project who drew a portrait of Nick will present it to Tracy at the ceremony.\n\nSouth of the River Band is also performing.\nPost a Comment\nSend Story to a Friend\nSend to Facebook\nShare to Twitter\n\nWTAP Mobile Web Home\n\n"}

We've made it through winter and into March, which means the official start of spring is just around the corner. And music fans can't wait. Over the next two months, Florida will host some great weekend music festivals that'll bring in everyone from Weezer to to the Zac Brown Band. California may have Coachella and Tennessee may have Bonnaroo (Page 35), but if you like camping, live music and fun in the sun, Florida's got it all. Here are the 10 biggest music festivals that'll hit the Sunshine State in March and April. \u2014 Jay Cridlin\n\nFlorida Strawberry Festival\n\nWhen and where: Through March 14 at the Florida Strawberry Festival grounds, 2202 W Reynolds St., Plant City\n\nWho it's for: Anyone who loves country music, strawberries and pig races\n\nHeadliners: Lynyrd Skynyrd, Darius Rucker, Julianne Hough, Tracy Lawrence, REO Speedwagon, Sara Evans, Michael W. Smith, Switchfoot, Bill Engvall, Josh Turner. There's also free entertainment daily.\n\nThe deal: Okay, it's not exactly a weekend fest \u2014 but still, for decades, the Strawberry Festival has brought world-class country talent to Hillsborough County, from Johnny Cash to Garth Brooks, from George Strait to Brad Paisley, from Loretta Lynn to Taylor Swift. Every year, there are tweaks to the lineup, which explains why this year's lineup is more heavy on rock (Lynyrd Skynyrd, REO Speedwagon, Switchfoot) than usual. This weekend's headliners include Julianne Hough and Bobby Bare on Friday, Michael W. Smith and Switchfoot on Saturday, and Darius Rucker and Heidi Newfield on Sunday. Young Nashville stud Billy Currington kicked off the festival Thursday night; go to on Friday morning for a concert review.\n\nTickets: Tickets to each concert range from $10 to $30, but about 3,000 free seats are available for headline shows on a first-come, first-served basis.\n\n\nHarvest of Hope Fest\n\nWhen and where: March 12-14, St. Johns County Fairgrounds, St. Augustine\n\nWho it's for: Forward-thinking outsider punk, hip-hop, indie and aggro-folk fans\n\nHeadliners: Billy Bragg, Broken Social Scene, Rogue Wave, Anvil, Dr. Dog, the Mountain Goats, Senses Fail, Anti-Flag, Kimya Dawson, Kid Sister, Cymbals Eat Guitars, Sea Wolf, Man Man, Dead Prez, Freelance Whales, Kool Keith, Matt Pond PA, Rev. Payton's Big Damn Band\n\nThe deal: In 2009, this first-time festival benefitting migrant farmworkers established itself as one of Florida's hippiest, drawing in 17,000 fans. This year's lineup doesn't quite match the hipster heights of last year's, but it's got a slew of eclectic on-the-rise indie bands, including a few from Tampa Bay (the Beauvilles, New Bruises, Too Many Daves, the Tim Version). Plus, for a three-day festival, you can't beat the price. (Several Harvest of Hope headliners, including Matt Pond PA, Kid Sister, Cory Branan and Jon Snodgrass, are also playing gigs in Tampa Bay in the next week or so.)\n\nTickets: Single-day: $25 through March 11, $35 at the gate. Three-day: $49.50 through March 11, $60 at the gate. Camping is $19.50.\n\n\nSuwannee Springfest\n\nWhen and where: March 25-28, Spirit of the Suwannee Music Park, Live Oak\n\nWho it's for: People who can't wait for Tropical Heatwave\n\nHeadliners: Leftover Salmon, Robert Earl Keen, Dirty Dozen Brass Band, Donna the Buffalo, Ruthie Foster, Jonathan Edwards, Peter Rowan\n\nThe deal: The genres may bend, from blues to zydeco to folk, but it's all part of a loosey-goosey collection of roots music that fans of WMNF-88.5 FM might like. They swear the event will be held \"rain or shine, war or peace.\" Bring a tent.\n\nTickets: Advance four-day tickets are $148.50\n\n\nUltra Music Festival\n\nWhen and where: March 26-27, Bicentennial Park, Miami\n\nWho it's for: DJs, club kids and house music lovers\n\nHeadliners: Tiesto, Deadmau5,, Passion Pit, Faithless Sound System, David Guetta, Orbital, Paul Oakenfold, Sasha and Digwaeed, Swedish House Mafia, Carl Cox, Armin Van Buuren, the Crystal Method, Damiam Marley and Nas\n\nThe deal: Ultra is actually part of the Winter Music Conference, which starts March 23 and is more of a networking and industry event. But there's no doubt South Beach will be especially hopping on these two days, when a who's who of the world's top DJs will be spinning beats. If you like electronic music \u2014 and don't feel like putting up with all the late-night party-tent hipsters at Coachella \u2014 this is the best festival in the country.\n\nTickets: Two-day general admission is $139.95; VIP tickets are $350\n\n\nTampa Bay Blues Fest\n\nWhen and where: April 9-11, Vinoy Waterfront Park, St. Petersburg\n\nWho it's for: Anyone who likes drowning their sorrows in sweet, tangy rib sauce\n\nHeadliners: Kenny Wayne Shepherd, Jimmie Vaughan, JJ Grey and Mofro, Bettye Lavette, Shemekia Copeland, Ryan Shaw\n\nThe deal: In its 15th year, Blues Fest has become Tampa Bay's biggest multi-day music festival \u2014 past headliners have included Jerry Lee Lewis, Buddy Guy, Robert Cray and George Thorogood. This year, a big highlight will be the \"After Hours\" parties each night at Nova 535 in St. Pete. For $20 each night, you can see some of the festival's performers, including Magic Slim and the Teardrops and Cedric Burnside and Lightnin' Malcolm, in a more intimate party setting.\n\nTickets: Single-day, $30-$150; three-day, $75-$325\n\n\nWanee Festival\n\nWhen and where: April 15-17, Spirit of the Suwannee Music Park, Live Oak\n\nWho it's for: Hippies!\n\nHeadliners: Allman Brothers Band (two shows), Widespread Panic, Gov't Mule, Derek Trucks and Susan Tedeschi Band, George Clinton and Parliament Funkadelic, the Funky Meters, the Wailers, North Mississippi Allstars, Stephen Stills, Bob Weir, Dr. John, the Black Keys, JJ Grey and Mofro, Sharon Jones and the Dap-Kings\n\nThe deal: Think jam bands, southern rockers, blues guitarists and folks who like to get their hemp on. This is what Bonnaroo used to be, before it went all Pitchfork and became more about indie rock (Bon Iver, Animal Collective), reunions (Phish, Pavement) and slumming megastars (Bruce Springsteen, R.E.M.). The Allmans also rocked Wanee last year.\n\nTickets: $178 through April 14; $188 at the gate\n\n\nFlorida Music Festival\n\nWhen and where: April 15-17, Downtown Orlando\n\nWho it's for: Unsigned artists and people who wish they were at South By Southwest\n\nHeadliners: A full lineup will be announced March 26\n\nThe deal: With more than 250 bands on some 15 stages in and around downtown Orlando \u2014 and an indie film festival to boot \u2014 this is clearly Florida's answer to SXSW. In its ninth year, it has attracted some decent headliners in the past \u2014 Filter, Third Eye Blind, Flogging Molly. (Asher Roth was booked last year, but he bailed at the last minute.) But it's mostly for unsigned artists, some of whom do go on to bigger things \u2014 alumni include Taylor Swift, The Academy Is... and Manchester Orchestra.\n\nTickets: Prices vary. Tickets go on sale April 1. See the Web site for details.\n\n\n\nWhen and where: April 16-18, Sertoma Youth Ranch, Brooksville\n\nWho it's for: Families and folks looking for an excuse to rev up the ol' RV\n\nHeadliners: Slaid Cleaves, Malcolm Holcombe, Crooked Still, Austin Lounge Lizards\n\nThe deal: This is laid-back and outdoorsy fun that's safe for music fans of all ages. If you want to teach your kids how to experience a music festival, but don't want to put up with the hipsters at Pitchfork, this rootsy, folksy, alt-country fest is for you.\n\nTickets: Three-day tickets: $85-$95 adults (includes RV parking, water/electric hookups extra), $20-$25 children 13-17. Two-day: $65-$75 adults. Saturday only: $35-$40 adults.\n\n\nSuwannee River Jam\n\nWhen and where: April 22-24, Spirit of the Suwannee Music Park, Live Oak\n\nWho it's for: Country music fans\n\nHeadliners: Zac Brown Band, John Fogerty, Travis Tritt, Kansas, Justin Moore, John Michael Montgomery, Colt Ford, LoCash Cowboys\n\nThe deal: There aren't many country mega-festivals out there, but River Jam is a good one. It'll be one of Floridians' first chances this spring to check out Best New Artist Grammy winners Zac Brown Band, as well as other country up-and-comers like Justin Moore and LoCash Cowboys. Giving this year's lineup a classic rock flavor are John Fogerty and Kansas.\n\nTickets: Single-day: $45-$55 kids, $75-$90 adults. Three-day: $130-$140.\n\n\n\nWhen and where: April 28-May 2, downtown West Palm Beach waterfront\n\nWho it's for: Fans of, uh, popular music\n\nHeadliners: Weezer, Flaming Lips, ZZ Top, Ben Harper and Relentless7, B-52s, Rise Against, Damian Marley, Nas, Shinedown, Patti LaBelle, Five For Fighting, Flogging Molly, Sister Hazel, Better than Ezra, Classic Albums Live: 40 Years of Woodstock\n\nThe deal: Billed as \"Florida's largest waterfront music and art festival,\" it's a bit like an oversized artwalk, only with a massive lineup of seriously huge, mainstream names \u2014 last year's slate included James Taylor, 311, David Cook and Slightly Stoopid. This year's lineup is a little more alt-friendly; both Weezer and Flaming Lips are playing this festival about six weeks before hitting Bonnaroo. SunFest 2010 will take place at the new $30 million West Palm Beach Waterfront, which opened in February.\n\nTickets: One-day passes start at $30-$32 adults, $8-$10 ages 6-12. Two-day passes are $46-$50 adults, $15-$17 ages 6-12. Five-day passes are $60-$65 adults, $20-$22 ages 6-12. Kids 5 and younger free; discounts for seniors.\n\n\nStrawberry Festival leads Florida's slate of spring music festivals 03/04/10 [Last modified: Thursday, March 4, 2010 11:14am]\nPhoto reprints | Article reprints\n\n\u00a9 2014 Tampa Bay Times\n\n\nJoin the discussion: Click to view comments, add yours"}

We see all kinds of animals along the way. There are usually tons of deer, chipmunks, squirrels, frogs and bunnies.

It's definitely worth sharing so here ya go: <BR> <BR> Get a deck of cards, a watch, and a set of weights. Find a space where you can run laps. They don't have to be extremely long laps. Just find a room that won't be too small and will drive you crazy. Shuffle the cards so you get a nice surprise. The number cards represent how many times you run back and forth. I count running to one side as one, not there and ... Thu, 8 Dec 2011 10:26:25 EST Support Thank everyone for their support. Every little bit helps and is greatly appreciated.

Recently I had to learn not to rely on the scale to check my fitness progress. I fluctuate so much and now I'm back where I started in pounds. I know now that this has nothing to do with failing my diet or workout program. I know this because my clothes fit better and I went down in pants size.

Today I'm going to Graceland and I'm soooo excited! Free ticket! So far the only thing that has stressed me out is my cats wanting food super early. Sat, 25 Jun 2011 08:41:36 EST Stress and Happiness! Stress Challenge- So my mom called today and she stresses me out more than anyone in the world. I know I should appreciate her because she's the only mom I'll have but she knows how to push my buttons! It's hard to see the situation from an outside point of view but I need to come up with a new approach. I usually get angry with her and I'm short with her. That's how I handled her this morning. I need to just try to let her be herself and accept what's given to me as long as it's coming from ... Fri, 24 Jun 2011 13:54:47 EST Stress-busting Challenge! So i joined another challenge just to keep motivated...well and to be less stressed. So i'm supposed to journal about the things that stress me out.

Wed, 15 Jun 2011 15:26:14 EST Positive Morning Energy So, since I've started working out, eating right and taking vitamins I've had crazy loads of energy when I wake up. Usually I wait until between 4-7 p.m. before I workout. This morning I woke up wanting to work out before I eat. So on top of the awesome energy I've been having, now I'm wanting to jump straight out of bed and workout. I'm lovin' it! Tue, 14 Jun 2011 14:06:56 EST YES! Let's have a great day! Sun, 5 Jun 2011 16:37:36 EST What is up with the amazingly high energy I'm having?!!!! I've been taking vitamins for a couple of weeks and lately tracking my fitness and nutrition. I wake up with a ridiculously high amount of energy and positivity. I want to share it with the world. Sat, 4 Jun 2011 13:02:16 EST Great Website! There's no doubt in my mind that being a member of sparkpeople and reading the site daily is a huge motivation. It's completely positive and very informative! Seeing how it's helped others is also very motivational. Thanks to the Spark Team and all of its members! Thu, 2 Jun 2011 20:01:31 EST"}

Rayne Brown, R-Davidson, knows all too well that House Bill 34, her bill defining women\u2019s nipples as indecent, has been the punchline of many a joke this session.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had the most fun with this bill for about the past week and a half, and that\u2019s OK. You need to laugh sometimes,\u201d she told the House Judiciary C Committee. \u201cBut there are communities across this state, there\u2019s local governments across this state, and also local law enforcement for whom this issue is really not a laughing matter.\u201d\n\nThe measure was requested by Asheville officials after participants in a women's rights rally held a second annual topless protest in a downtown park last summer.\n\nBrown, whose district is more than 100 miles from Asheville, said she hadn\u2019t planned to get involved with the issue until she started getting calls about it from her constituents. \u201cI felt that, if this was of concern to my constituents, it was going to be of concern to others as well.\u201d\n\nBrown says topless protests are actually illegal under the current law, but there\u2019s some confusion about it, dating to conflicting court rulings from the 1970s.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got local governments passing ordinances to protect themselves from just this thing,\u201d she said. \u201cThese folks don\u2019t need to be doing that, but they do it because they\u2019re not sure about the law.\n\n\u201cThis bill that I\u2019m presenting in no way shape or form changes North Carolina law,\u201d she said, \u201cbut we do need clarification.\u201d\n\nNorth Carolina law already forbids \u201cindecent exposure,\u201d but it doesn\u2019t specifically define \u201cprivate parts\u201d as including breasts.\n\nThe proposal adds that definition, including \u201cthe nipple, or any portion of the areola, of the human female breast,\u201d with an exception made for breastfeeding.\n\n\u201cAll we are doing is codifying the Supreme Court definition of \u2018private parts,\u2019\" added committee Chairwoman Rep. Sarah Stevens, R-Surry. \u201cThat\u2019s it. \u201c\n\n\nStevens said using pasties or other nipple coverings would protect those women against prosecution. \u201cThey\u2019d be good to go.\u201d\n\nRep. Tim Moore, R-Cleveland, quipped, \u201cYou know what they say \u2013 duct tape fixes everything.\u201d\n\nThe measure passed the committee on a nearly-unanimous voice vote. Its next stop will be the House floor.\n\n\nThis blogpost is closed for comments.\n\nOldest First\nView all\n  \u2022 illseagle Feb 16, 11:41 p.m.\n\n    When did the human brest become indecent? 7 billion people on this earth have them, and when G*d saw Adam and Eve (without a stich of clothing) He said it was good. Is Rayne Brown smarter than G*d?\n\n  \u2022 zenonx6 Feb 14, 4:22 p.m.\n\n    Just tell'm it's not against the law and they won't do it.\n\n  \u2022 jgilchr Feb 14, 9:25 a.m.\n\n    The Republican nanny state\n\n  \u2022 mentalgoose Feb 14, 9:25 a.m.\n\n    This bill is absurd and sexist. There are men out there who have bigger breasts than some women, and it is a-OK for them to go out in public topless. How is that any more decent than a woman baring her breasts? Seriously, who are these people and why are they so ashamed of being human?\n\n  \u2022 uragoner2 Feb 13, 2:29 p.m.\n\n    More tax payer waste of time... Term Limits, America, Term limits\n\n  \u2022 Scubagirl Feb 13, 1:46 p.m.\n\n    don't we have more pressing issues that need to be dealt with. Do we REALLY need to be told what 'private parts' means......has our society gotten THAT stupid?????????"}

More show cars than last time and the spectator crowd was up. I counted 77 show cars + a lot more in the VW parking lot that didn't enter. Several busses including a very nice original 21 window from Denton that I had not seen before. Also, managed to beat the swap meet flipers to some of the bus bargains by shopping the motel parking lot the night before the show. Scored an almost perfect and complete slash rear bumper, early front splash pan, and several 58-61 bus tail lights. Eat you heart out Peter.\n\nEnnis isn't dead. Warren promised to be back next year in the spring and again in the fall (hopefully without any date conflicts). Didn't choose Ennis over Boerne because of the quality of the show, otherwise would have gone to Boerne. But, Boerne is 300 + miles one way and Ennis is about 150. And, with the shorter distance my daughter Shelley was able to drive her Thing and go to a show. Hopefully I will be able to make Boerne next year.\n\nAm making Lafayett next week and Ft.

{"dataman_score": 4.0, "text": "Radish and Grapefruit Salad\n\nIn the past, I\u2019ve always thought of\u00a0radishes as kind of a poor cousin to beets: smaller and more anemic, they obviously missed out on the family jewels.\u00a0 Without well-heeled\u00a0connections or an established\u00a0vocation, they\u2019re much like the street punk with the\u00a0pugilistic attitude,\u00a0slamming your jaw with a peppery punch every time you dare\u00a0take a bite.\n\nAnd besides, radishes seem to me\u00a0more or less a\u00a0one-hit wonder:\u00a0 like the obnoxious neighbour (you know the\u00a0guy: loud, grating voice;\u00a0beer belly) who always gets drunk at the annual Bar B Q and tells the same joke every year,\u00a0radishes were used for one thing and one thing only: salad.\u00a0 And they were always raw.\u00a0 And they were always sliced.\u00a0 Not horrible, but not exactly inspiring, either.\u00a0 Sort of like Julia Roberts: no matter what the context, no matter what else surrounds them, no matter what time of year, they\u2019re always pretty much exactly themselves.\u00a0 Even\u00a0when carved into one of those fancy garnish \u201croses\u201d\u2013a radish is a\u00a0radish is a radish.\n\nWell, last week, I intended to\u00a0change all that.\u00a0\n\nI\u2019ve been hanging on to this recipe, originally\u00a0from\u00a0the LCBO\u2019s\u00a0\u00a0Food and Drink Magazine from\u00a0early 2004\u00a0(LCBO is\u00a0\u201cLiquor Control Board of Ontario\u201d\u2013that\u2019s right, the government is the sole\u00a0purveyor of alcohol in our time-warped province), since I first saw it. I\u2019d kept it all this time\u00a0simply because I loved the photo in the magazine so much (have you ever seen the production values of that mag?\u00a0 No wonder the Ontario government is short on cash).\u00a0 Well, I can thank my blogging habit once again for prompting me to finally make the dish and\u00a0take my own shot of the colorful mix.\n\nIt must have been some weird synergy in the not-quite-summer air, but in the interim since I made this salad, I\u2019ve noticed two other bloggers with radish recipes as well:\u00a0Lisa just whipped up\u00a0some fabulous looking Potato and Radish Salad,\u00a0and Karen actually roasted the little roots, something I\u2019ve never thought to do (she swears they\u2019re pretty darned good that way).\n\nThis salad was deceptively simple\u2013only seven ingredients\u2013but it was the particular combination that sounded so enticing.\u00a0 Radishes, sliced paper-thin (unfortunatelly, not in my case\u2013must get that mandoline!), embraced\u00a0by thick, juicy wedges of grapefruit; with\u00a0thin rounds of young green onion and glossy olives tinted like black plums scattered throughout. Like a little dinner party with your most eclectic group of friends, all in one place!\n\nIt came together in no time at all, and didn\u2019t disappoint.\u00a0 The result was unusual, yes, but oddly pleasing: tart, salty, peppery, juicy\u2013the perfect side to a light summer dinner of lentil patties (more on those anon).\n\nBased on this salad, I\u2019d say the lowly radish has finally broken free from the previously predictable, nondescript\u00a0dishes it\u2019s graced in the past.\u00a0 I actually enjoyed experiencing the radish in a starring role in\u00a0this dish.\n\nNow, if only I could say the same for Ms. Roberts.\n\nRadish and Grapefruit Salad\n\nfrom Food and Drink, Spring 2004\n\nCrisp and light, this will remind you of summer, even though it can be prepared any time of year.\u00a0 The singular mix of flavors and textures creates a uniquely appealing salad. The original instructions advise: \u201cDo not add the dressing until just before serving or else the salad will give off too much liquid.\u201d\n\n\n4 small grapefruit [I used a mixture of white and red]\n\n4 green onions, thinly sliced [I used the white and some of the green parts]\n\n1/2 cup (125 ml.) pitted black olives\n\n12 radishes, thinly sliced\n\n\n1/4 cup (60 ml.) extra virgin olive oil\n\n3 Tbsp. (45 ml.) grapefruit juice\n\nsalt and freshly ground pepper, to taste\n\nPeel the grapefruit and cut into sections over a bowl, to catch the juice (this should give you enough juice\u2013or more than enough\u2013to make the dressing).\u00a0 Place the grapefruit sections, green onions, olives and radishes in a salad bowl. Chill until ready to serve.\n\nWhisk together the dressing ingredients.\u00a0 Just before serving, pour dressing over the salad and gently toss together.\u00a0 Serves four.\u00a0 Best eaten right away.\n\nTOTAL HEALTH CODA: Well, I can hardly believe it\u2019s been six weeks already since I started this course\u2013only three more to go! I can tell from the feel of my clothes that I\u2019m going to be disappointed in the area of weight loss.\u00a0 However, I can say unequivocally that I\u2019ve been eating more healthfully over the past six weeks than I was the six weeks before that.\u00a0 I\u2019ve also discovered some wonderful new dishes that are both simple and nourishing.\u00a0\n\nTonight\u2019s topic was\u00a0digestion and how to consume foods in a way that ensures optimum absorption of nutrients.\u00a0Much of this was review from my nutrition school days, but good to hear again, nonetheless.\u00a0 And we\u2019ve also each been asked to think about what kind of cleanse we\u2019ll attempt before the course is over (it will be different for each of us, depending where we are in our diets when we begin).\u00a0 The wheels are turning already!\n\nRelated Posts Plugin for WordPress, Blogger...\n\n\n  1. I love your analogy of radishes. I always thought they were too bland, but pairing them with delicious fruits sounds like a great way to make up for it.\n\n    Even though you\u2019re not losing weight in your courses, it\u2019s great that you have a good attitude about it, keep it up! You can incorporate all your knowledge into your daily life and maybe in the long term it will help you lose that weight you want off. =)\n\n  2. I\u2019ve never been a fan of radishes, but your salad is enough to make me want to try them again!! Yum!!\n\n    Wow, six weeks already?? That class is really flying by!! You\u2019re still doing great with your health, Ricki \u2013 don\u2019t worry about the lack of weight loss!!\n\n  3. The radishes and grapefruit look so refreshing! And the olives make it completely irresistible. I will definitely have to make this for summer.\n\n  4. I love radishes and grapefruit:). What a simple and creative little salad!! Thanks for a great idea:).\n\n  5. Radishes are so good for you but I don\u2019t eat them enough. Pairing them with the grapefruit sounds like a great way to prepare them!\n\n  6. Thanks for the shout out, Ricki!! I\u2019m flattered. Just want to give you the heads up to proceed to my blog with caution today. I just put up a recipe for chocolate beet cake that can easily be a vegan with a small change. This cake rocked my world. Hubby is not a chocolate fan (he doesn\u2019t like Neil Diamond, either. Go figure) But anyway, he LOVED this cake. I LOVED it. But I had to get it out the house. So, he took it to work. But, now I want a piece. Arrgh.\n\n  7. A very unusual pairing that I would like to taste. I came over here to print off a recipe of yours and now it seems I\u2019m printing two. By the way, I will be posting a few recipes containing mint over the next little while that might interest you.\n\n  8. That\u2019s a simple yet snappy salad! Radish can be so harsh, yet grapefruit\u2019s got its own strength to slap it down. Excellent combo!\n\n  9. \u2014\u201cNot horrible, but not exactly inspiring, either.\u201d\n\n    That perfectly sums up my past experiences with radishes. I think, thanks to your inspiration, I will make them my \u201cnew food\u201d this week, and I will try them your way.\n\n  10. Um, I\u2019m sorry\u2013 no idea why that posted thrice!\n\n  11. Romina,\n    The grapefruit was a really good foil for the radish (or vice versa, not sure!). And thanks for the words of encouragement\u2013they helped! :)\n\n    They\u2019re probably worth another try :) . And thanks for the support\u2013yes, health is more important than weight loss!\n\n    It did turn out to be a pretty good combination\u2013best I\u2019ve found for radishes, so far, anyway!\n\n    Glad you like it! And nice to know that someone out there does actually love radishes! ;)\n\n    I\u2019m the same way\u2013hardly ever eat \u2018em. But this salad is something I\u2019d have again.\n\n    How could I read your comment and NOT go look? Sounds wonderful\u2013the radishes would be jealous ;)\n\n    So glad you liked it! And I can\u2019t wait to check out more mint-based recipes\u2013I always find something I like over at your blog!\n\n    I think you\u2019re right; it\u2019s the strength of the grapefruit that actually makes the radish more appealing.\n\n    Yay! Another new food to try. They really are pretty good this way! (Oh, and I deleted the other 2 identical comments\u2013how weird!).\n\n  12. radish and grapefruit makes me want to run a mile \u2013 I have never understood the grapefruit \u2013 at least the radish makes lovely roses! I think I associate grapefruit with my mother trying to eat a healthy breakfast in the days when I would much prefer coco pops cereal and peanut butter on toast! Not much hope for me is there :-)\n\n  13. PS \u2013 but your photo looks worthy of the glossy mag (sorry even that isn\u2019t enough to tempt me)\n\n  14. That sounds like a wonderful combination\u2013I love the slight bitterness of radishes\u2013it is so lovely when paired with something sweeter. I\u2019ll bet the tartness of the grapefruit would work beautifully with the taste\u2013it sure looks gorgeous!\n\n  15. Johanna,\n    Funny, I feel about radishes like you feel about grapefruit! I love a good, juicy red grapefruit just as a snack. It\u2019s quite a different experience if you peel it and eat like an orange. And thanks for the comment about the photo\u2013it was the colors of the salad that drew me in the first place!\n\n    I think you\u2019ve hit it perfectly\u2013it\u2019s those combinations of flavors that do make this work, somehow! Unusual, but works! :)\n\n  16. Wow! That sounds so quirky and divine! I love it!\n\n  17. Impressive bid and description \u2013\n    Greetings !\n\n    Magic salad.\n    Great taste and aroma.\n    Thank you very much\n\n\n  1.

In just 0.38 seconds, too.\n\n1. I get 5940.\n\n2. The tenth one down is a link to a post on this site, deriding reporters for using the word \"scrappy\" in articles about David Eckstein.\n\n3. I love -- love -- that you cite the short time it took for Google to do the search. As if that is in some way indicative of just how fucking scrappy this guy is. \"If you search for 'Carlos Guillen scrappy,' it takes Google .41 seconds to show results. 'Bill Doran scrappy?' .40 seconds. But type in 'David Eckstein scrappy' and you will have your results in .38 seconds. Even Google knows just how scrappy this guy is.\"\n\nThen again, when you've hauled off a .289 average and .351 on-base percentage over seven major-league seasons that include a pair of World Series rings and a Series MVP award ... well, \"scrappy\" will turn up a bit.\n\nWhy? Why will it show up? Manny Ramirez has \"hauled off\" (and why that verb?) far far better numbers in the last seven years. He also won a WS MVP. No one calls him scrappy. Here. Let me rewrite your last sentence for you.\n\nThen again, when you're small and you play baseball and are just kind of mediocre and lazy sportswriters don't want to bother coming up with anything new to say about you so they literally google your name and the word \"scrappy\" and then actually flaunt how lazy they are by writing into the article that the way they decided to write this article was to fucking google your name and the word \"scrappy,\" in a move reminiscent of how we all used to begin Social Studies papers in junior high by writing like \"Webster's Dictionary defines 'democracy' as...\" or whatever... well, \"scrappy\" will turn up a bit.\n\nThere. I think that's clearer.\n\nIt's just in the mindset, Eckstein explained yesterday during a conference call from the Tampa airport. He'd just cleared his medical and was officially aboard for the 2008 season at $4.5 million (all figures U.S.).\n\nAfter the doctors give Eckstein a medical examination, do they sometimes get confused and give him a lollypop? (I'm not sure that's a good joke, and I was just about to cut it, but now the image of Eckstein in like 1950's clothes licking an oversized swirly-colored lollypop is in my head and it makes me laugh. So: it stays in.)\n\n\"It's more an attitude of showing up every day, ready to give you 100 per cent,\" Eckstein said. \"You'll never see me a take a pitch off, a day off ... that's what I bring. I think it's my best quality.\n\nIt certainly isn't \"good hitter.\"\n\n\"It may be the reality \u2013 that when you're a smaller guy, you have to play better than the other guys \u2013 but I'm a little stubborn. When you're small, you don't think you're small.\"\n\nDo you think you're \"scrappy?\" Because everyone else does.\n\nIf Allan Ryan is a high school student from a nearby school who has gotten an internship at the Star and this is his first published article: congratulations! I wish you the best in your career as a journalist. If this is any other situation: yikes.\n\nLabels: ,\n\nposted by Ken Tremendous\u00a0\u00a0# 12:00 PM\nThanks to Alexander for the tip.\nAs many of you pointed out, this article was printed in the Toronto Star, not the Toronto Sun, as I originally wrote. The Toronto Sun is a goofy low-grade tabloid, which would never have printed something as frivolous and pointless as a google search for \"David Eckstein scrappy.\"\nPost a Comment\n\n<< Home\n\n\n\nThis page is powered by Blogger.

They went from frilly to serious to business class. Some were elegant, other ones a rather garish pink leather, but all were pretty close to the standard ASUS laptop you have probably all seen before.\n\nThe most obvious standout is the Lamborghini notebook. This one is based off existing designs, and oriented heavily at the multimedia sector, note the remote sitting beside it. They would not give out any details because it is going to 'debut' tomorrow, but I can say it is a PM based model, not AMD. Comparisons to the Acer Ferrari are inevitable, but Asus completely denies any similarities.\n\n\nAesthetically, this notebook is quite pleasing, it is a shiny black color, with all the trendy lights in the right places and a Lambo badge on the case. Nothing to complain about, just a solid looking computer with similarly solid specs. The problem for me is that there is little to tie it in to the car maker besides a badge. If it comes at little or no premium, I would have nothing against it, but if it hits you in the checkbook, go for the model without the badge, and buy an extra battery instead.\n\nAsus Lamborghini notebook closed\n\nThe other notebooks were notable mainly for one unique feature. I would go into detail about the models, but since I neglected to write down thins like names and specs, much vaguer descriptions will have to do. The main thing is the extensive use of aluminum. Most companies use plastic for the shells and keyboard surrounds on laptops, it is easier to work with, you can just mold it. Asus has several models will full blown aluminum shells and wrist wrests. They feel quite solid, and are probably a lot more wear resistant than the normal low rent plastic. This is definite plus in my book.\n\nOn the opposite of plus side, there was a pink leather clad notebook. The lid and the wrist rests were covered in a lizard-skin patterned leatherish substance. When I say pink, I mean pink, this thing would set off alarms in a nuclear plant. You can see some of it in the corner of the closed Lambo shot, but it is much brighter in person. Not my thing, but there are those who will just love it, I am sure.\n\nLastly comes the most impressive single feature of the bunch, a secondary display and controller on the lid. It has a little color LCD and a four way pad to allow you to do a bunch of things without turning the PC on. If you use your computer as a music station, this will be very useful to you. It won't change any lives in a meaningful way, but it is quite handy.\u00b5\n\n\n\nShare this:\n\nblog comments powered by Disqus\nSubscribe to INQ newsletters\n\n\nINQ Poll\n\nDead electronic devices to be banned on US-bound flights\n\nWill the new rules banning uncharged devices be effective?"}

Charter schools are not currently allowed under state law.\n\nThe letter states that I-\u00ad1240 would take millions from public schools to pay for privately-run charter schools, that it ignores 99 percent of the state's students, and that it ignores a solution for all children.\n\nLocal parents Tori Lindquist and Jackie Brown also signed the letter, which is attached as aPDF attachment to this article (click to enlarge).\n\nMore local support seems to be on backing the Yes on I-1240 campaign. Mercer Island couple Jackie and Mike Bezos, parents of Amazon.com CEO and founder Jeff Bezos, gave $1 million and are frequently listed on campagin ads on television. State Senator Steve Litzow, PTA and Stand for Children board member Judy Chase, former Elmhurst, IL School Board of Education member Jim Faulstich, and music teacher Connie Wible, business owner Carol Gullstad, and Frederick H. Beck also count themselves as supporters, according to the Yes on I-1240 website.\n\n(Ed. Note: This story was updated to add information to describe local supporters of the Yes on I-1240 campaign.)\n\nTrevor Hart November 03, 2012 at 08:40 PM\nState money follows the kid. If the kid moves out of the public school system that's less kids tax supported schools need to accomodate. From what I've seen, this should be a win - win. The kid gets a better education in the Charter School and the Public Schools get to reduce their class size to supposedly, and hopefully, improve their performance.\nKendall Watson November 04, 2012 at 06:51 PM\nTani Lindquist, who it appears did not sign the letter, is the current teachers union leader \u2014 or Mercer Island Education Association (MIEA) president, to use the formal term.\nDave Myerson November 05, 2012 at 02:45 AM\nI have received queries why I oppose I-1240, and offer the following explanation. On the one hand, I would love to see some competition among public schools\u2013and charters could provide that. Through such competition, parents might be able to find a school with a solid elementary math curriculum, one based primarily on direct instruction and problems to solve, and not one that asks students to learn several different multiplication algorithms. The Singapore text comes to my mind. On the other hand, I-1240 does not afford sufficient accountability to tax payers. I am very reluctant to spend tax money without the direction of an elected School Board. If I-1240 is implemented, any private party founding a charter school could choose a superintendent or principal, and they would receive state tax monies, but would only be loosely accountable, and that 5 years down the road to an appointed body. That is not nearly enough accountability, and taxation without representation. In addition, our local Mercer Island school tax levies would go not just to MI public schools, but to any charter(s) located within Mercer Island. The students may or may not live in Mercer Island. There is a requirement that charter school(s) accept students from all districts on an equal basis. Any suitably located charter school can tap our taxes. That is local taxation without local benefit. For me, this bill has the fatal problem of siphoning tax money to parties not accountable to the electorate.\nLisa Thomas November 05, 2012 at 03:17 AM\nSo Tori Lindquist, who signed the letter according to your article, is not the same as Tani Lindquist. Are they related?\nKendall Watson November 05, 2012 at 05:41 PM\nThank you very much Director Myerson for taking the time to explain your position on Mercer Island Patch. I'd also like to clarify to all readers of this story (I've added an editor's note at the end) that Mr. Faulstich was a school board member, but not on Mercer Island. He was elected board member on the Elmhurst Board of Education in Illinois. According to the Elmhurst Board of Ed., Faulstich served from 1974 to 1977.\n\n\nMore \u00bb\nNote Article\nSee more\u00a0\u00bb"}

{"dataman_score": 4.0, "text": "A new plan by the FCC to keep the Universal Service Fund stocked in anticipation of the coming August exemption for DSL providers will likely lead to higher VoIP bills for consumers. The agency has ruled that companies like Vonage and SunRocket who offer Internet telephony services must now pay 7% of their revenue into the fund -- used to subsidize rural and low-income phone service -- which has been traditionally been stocked by taxing POTS and DSL providers at a rate of 10.9%. However, since DSL providers have been let off the hook for this program, the FCC needed to make up for the shortfall, so the agency both instituted the VoIP component and raised cellular carriers' contribution from 3% to 4%. Since providers tend to pass new costs on to the consumer, we can probably expect to see higher VoIP bills in the near future, but luckily the recent repeal of that Spanish-American war-era excise tax should mostly balance things out on the cellphone side of things."}

They will live this every day, whether the lights are on or not,\" Gilchrist said.\n\nGilchrist also raised several issues with the manner in which the college has gone about selling residents on the proposed towers.\n\nFor one, the college has said that the lights will only be on for 10 scheduled games of the year. For the first time in the hearings, Siena officials stated that they would like to use the lights for practice any opportunity they could.\n\nResident Sharon Alley, who has led the charge against the proposal, also pointed out that the college has already put in the four footings to mount the lights. Building Department Director Michael Rosch confirmed that Siena had only been given a building permit for the new field and accessory bleachers, not the footings for the lights.\n\n\"We have come to the hearings, listened with opened minds, and we are still adamantly opposed to these towers. We are not against higher education, we are not against Siena, we are not even against athletics,\" said Sharon Bright Holub, president of the Greater Loudonville Association.\n\nHolub stated that there has not been good dialogue between Siena and its neighbors, and that the proposal is more than a matter of what is permitted by town law; rather, it's a matter of community and the impact four, 90-foot light towers would have on it, she said.\n\nVote on this Story by clicking on the Icon\n\n\n\nSign in to comment"}

What percentage do you believe fit into the above categories?\n\nMaybe you're nicer than me (most probably) or more accepting of others (I hope so) but after over seven years of forced occupation with some of these cretins, I believe I have become a bonafide expert.\n\nIs every patient a jerk? Of course not. I don't tend to socialize at treatment simply because my psyche associates every living creature, every piece of equipment to be pure, bloodied evil.\n\nBut that's just me. I have serious issues.\n\nThere just happens to be individuals who will inflict their will on you, regardless of good manners, proper etiquette, or just good old fashioned courtesy.\n\nWhich brings me to the point of this post:\n\n*** The Top 3 Evildoers of Dialysis ***\n\n3) The Godfather of Farts\n\nSaturdays are chaotic at Dialysis, and its no fault of the staff. Most of the time, everyone is running late because knuckleheads who've missed treatment during the week call at the last minute and whine about needing a treatment.\n\nIf you missed appointments anywhere else, they would tell you to fuck off and slam the phone down.\n\nBut not at Dialysis. Unfortunately.\n\nI'm usually a Monday, Wednesday, Friday patient, so I know who to expect when I enter the rancid floor.\n\nBut because my pussy body can't make it through the weekend, I add an extra day to the treatment week.\n\nThat's right, I allow Dialysis to ruin my weekends.\n\nSo instead of patients like Neckish Princess and Petite Raven Hair, I'm forced to endure the Godfather of Farts.\n\nI am going to make an assumption about this individual, so bear with me.\n\nHis diet led him to Dialysis.\n\nFrom the moment he enters, he's farting. And not just run-of-the-mill, all-American, I-just-had-Chicken-McNuggets and a loaf of cheese farts.\n\nI must take a moment now and quote my hero, George Carlin:\n\n\"The kind of fart that could strip the varnish off a foot locker. A fart that could end a marriage.\"\n\nThe ventilation system at my clinic is non-existent, so clouds of farts hang around him.\n\nHugging him. Cherishing him. Asking for more toxic farts.\n\nAnd if this gentleman walked into any Italian bar, he would be welcome with open arms because he looks just like Marlon Brando in \"The Godfather.\" You'd have to do a double blink and roll your fists into your eyes and glance again. Its astonishing really.\n\nHe also likes to mock patients when they're in pain, so maybe he should be higher on the list.\n\n2) Masturbating Fred Flintstone\n\nIf Raven Haired Temptress hadn't informed me of his behavior, I probably wouldn't have noticed. Once I'm leaned back into my chair, the laptop flies open so I can lose myself in the latest attempt at a blockbuster from Hollywood.\n\nHe wears plaid shorts and no underwear. Once treatment starts, his rainbow blanket flies over his body, Telemundo gets switched on and this guy goes to town.\n\nI feel bad for the staff when it comes to patients like this. How do you even broach the subject?\n\nAnd does he ever wash that blanket?\n\nSince his hygeine is also in questions (how difficult is it to shower more than once a week) I'm going to guess, hmm, less than never.\n\n1) Jabba the Hutt\n\nWho could be worse than a chronic farter & addictive masturbator?\n\nWelcome to the human form of Jabba the Hutt.\n\nFrom the moment he enters, the flip flops fly off and he's shuffling around barefoot.\n\nTo those not aware, here's what he could be stepping in:\n\nBlood. Vomit. Feces. Spit. And, since the masturbator is on my shift, apparently semen.\n\nI understand taking your shoes off because your feet are swollen. Occasionaly, I'm forced to do that. But prancing around barefoot?\n\nHe also eats the entire time he's there. Candy and junk food.\n\nAs I've mentioned previously, the aroma of unwashed ass and baby poop hugs the air in my clinic. Why would you ever want to eat?\n\nThe worse is when halfway through his treatment he vomit.\n\nIt happens. Again, I get it. But you brought this on yourself.\n\nAnd once the staff cleans him up, he goes back to...eating.\n\nOne night I couldn't take the smell anymore. Like stale swiss cheese and burnt hair. Like he hadn't washed his feet since the Bicentennial.\n\nThis night was the second time in my seven year history that I've signed paperwork to get off the machine early. The other time, the stairwell at my apartment had collapsed.\n\nNow you get the idea of how horribly awful it was.\n\nIf you're about to start Dialysis, here's what I recommend:\n\n1) Noise cancelling headphones.\n\nThis is mostly for the Emmy award winners who scream on their cellphones, unwilling to comprehend that cell technology has reached a point where you could whisper and the individual on the other end could hear you.\n\n2) Lavender\n\nSome of the drains get backed up with all the urine that is extracated from patients, so you'll want to be prepared. Also, unless you're on the night shift (and even then) other patients may not shower regularly. Its sad, but its a fact you'll have to deal with.\n\n3) DVD Player\n\nThree hours crawls by without distractions. You can get great deals at Target (and the salespeople won't hassle you like at \"Best Buy\") with batteries that last long past your scheduled treatment time.\n\n4) A Taser\n\nOk, now I'm just kidding. Sort of.\n\nMonday, July 25, 2011\n\nThe Pain of Lidocaine\n\nI am a wimp. A fool. A terrestrial being with nothing extra about him.\n\nFor what seems like an exponential lifetime, I have been a Dialysis patient.\n\nThere is no B.D. (before Dialysis) anymore. Its been too long. Too hard. Too infinite.\n\nChildhood, college, the beginning of my career. They all seem like chapters from a book that I checked out from the library ages ago.\n\nAll the facets that melded those memories into one cohesive whole: happiness, joy, triumph; they're all just forgotten words now.\n\nBut its about to become tremendously worse.\n\nFor ages, I've used lidocine to ease my pain. You're right. I'm one of those geniuses of the highest order who receives two needle sticks.\n\nBefore two needle sticks.\n\nExcessive? Sure. Redundant? Definately.\n\nBut totally, and without a doubt, necessary.\n\nWhen the lidocaine misses its intended target, the main needle shrieks in terror as it enters my helpless arm.\n\nEvery. Single. Time.\n\nYou would think any normal human being (i.e. not me) would adjust to this psychologically. Physically. Mentally. Emotionally.\n\nMy Fear of needles has become a massively disgusting mass of burden upon my shoulders. It festers there, cowers, whimpers in pain whether a Tech knows their business or not.\n\nWord was given to me on bleach white paper that lidocaine is \"not allowed in cases where a buttonwhole access is concerned.\"\n\nIt was highlighted in colorful, mocking orange. As though I would have missed it otherwise.\n\nChatty Cathy Nurse walked to my side and asked if I had read this.\n\n\"Yes,\" I said as I gathered my crappy possessions. \"But I don't believe in it.\"\n\nAs if that would have ended it right there. I could only hope.\n\nShe was bounding with verbal, anxious speech. That's actually how she always speaks.\n\n\"We had a meeting and that rule is supposed to be followed.\"\n\nI grabbed my items and shoved the strap over my shoulder, knocking Fear from its perch.\n\n\"No lidocaine. No Dialysis. I'll stop if I have to.\"\n\nThere was no emotion in my voice. No waver in my step.\n\nChatty Cathy Nurse made that sound she always makes when she's not sure how to respond: \"Aaah...ohhh...\"\n\nI'm sure Happy, Smiley manager will lose those adjectives from her face when she hear this, but Lidocaine has been my only friend in the fight against Fear.\n\nMy psyche is held together with second tier Scotch tape and fractured, muddied shoelaces. You take away one of the few friends I have in that Haunting Haven of Hell (TM 2011) and my edge will have been reached.\n\n\"I'll stop if I have to.\"\n\nThat isn't an empty threat filled with shallow nonchalance. It is the truth as I know it on this day, the twenty fifth of July, two thousand eleven.\n\nSunday, July 24, 2011\n\nIn the Beginning\n\nThere was a rambunctious Sperm and a reclusive Ovum. The Sperm was charming and funny. The Ovum, quiet, yet intelligent. And a little wacky.\n\nThere were rivers of Sperm and islands of Ovum, but these two particular individuals felt their pairing was bathed in the bastion of Fate.\n\nThe Sperm felt comfortable and welcome in the warm embrace of this particular Ovum, there was no denying it.\n\nAt the moment the Ovum decided that no other Sperm would venture into her womb, something electrical happened that was quite unexpected.\n\nLife began.\n\nIt was undeniable that these two forces of unapologetic nature would come together to create another. Fate deemed it so.\n\nAnd so Fate, with all its immense power and glory over the futile lives of man, shifted ever so slightly.\n\nIn the grand scheme of Creation, it was so minscule as to be unwarranted for further moments of discussion.\n\nBut we shall. Here. Now. Without regret or blame.\n\nFor something went horribly wrong.\n\nThe fusion of love and happenstance should have fused together to create something joyous and pure. Something innocent and unfettered.\n\nSomething the Universe could tower proudly over and declare, \"At least I got this right goddamnit!\"\n\nBut Fate had other plans.\n\nFate deems all other rules negated by its own.\n\nFate vomits on hopes, dreams and possibilities.\n\nFate trashes those it deems unworthy to live a life worth living.\n\nMany will point and mock and deem Fate non-existent, for they can't grab it with their pudgy little fingers and shove it down their ungodly throats.\n\nI am living proof that they are so very, very wrong.\n\nWhat began as bursts of frivolity, splashed upon the face of an unblemished young boy, quickly morphed into discovery of the true nature of Pain.\n\nThe first piercing needle was never as bad as the last.\n\nFate determining that I should experience that about 127 minutes ago.\n\nOne rambunctious Sperm. One reclusive Ovum.\n\nNothing but Fate in-between.\n\nAnd so, it goes.\n\nTuesday, March 01, 2011\n\nThe Terrific Tale of the Transplant Listiversary\n\nThrough the folds of imagination and misery, please travel back with me to the wily time of March 2004.\n\nSpring was blossoming into a ravishing young woman, about to use her comely wiles to entice Winter to leave his magnificent throne of Weather.\n\nDown upon the skin of Planet Earth, humans were battling one another continuously over who could acquire the most meaningless mass of material, not realizing each acquisition was biting away at their ever deflated Soul.\n\nIt is within these constructs that we join our Protagonist, Happy-Go-Lucky Stacy.\n\nFor what he lacked in stature and mass, he made up for in personality and whimsy. Every day he would use technology to broadcast his thoughts over magical airwaves of sound, infuriating and entertaining at every possible turn.\n\nEvenings were especially rambunctious, for Happy-Go-Lucky Stacy filled them with ravishing women of beauty and brilliance, giggling and dancing as they ransacked the town.\n\nBut as Fate struck midnight, all would change. And not for the better.\n\nStatements on-air became forgetful and rambling. What was once food both tasty and vibrant, exited just as quickly, vile and unwanted.\n\nA doctor both portly and friendly, brimming with knowledge and depth, thrust a tiny sword into Stacy's reluctant upper arm and gathered a massive amount of Blood Red Soul.\n\nHappy-Go-Lucky Stacy knew the answer, for the Doctor's face was mired in doubt.\n\n\"Your CKD has caused CKF. So I'm recommending HD, ASAP, before you end up DOA and don't PAY.\"\n\nApparently our Mighty Doctor was in a hurry, for she felt that acronyms would suffice for her Tiny Peon Patient.\n\nHappy-Go-Lucky Stacy had created, unwillingly, a wonderfully tasty soup of Fear and Loathing and allowed it to brew for eight weeks before giving in to the horrific creature known as Dialysis.\n\nUpon entering Dialysis' Castle of Forgotten Souls, Happy-Go-Lucky Stacy felt his adjectives becoming weak. \"Happy\" scurried away with tears in his eyes. \"Go\" bolted for the wrong door, slammed himself into a closet, and stayed there until the custodial staff arrived. \"Lucky\" instantly burst into a million forlorn pieces and hasn't been seen or heard from since.\n\nSo with each step lonelier than the last, Stacy entered the cavernous dwelling of disaster, and was met by his twisted host.\n\nHe was shaped awkwardly like the letter \"C\" with a tiny, slender frame. Barely noticeable hands and miniature feet jutted from each end of his alphabet frame. They continuously moved and gyrated, begging for the use of appendages that were never to be.\n\nAt the top end of his body, an oval mass of flesh served as his head. Wiry and dry, his green stained hair whisked in all different directions when he spoke. When he smiled, every tooth was shaped hopelessly like a sharp letter \"V\", giving way to stains from colors not yet named.\n\nWith every step Stacy made closer to the dungeoned chair, Dialysis would bound from wall to wall, laughing and screaming with unmitigated delight.\n\n\"Yyyyyoooooouuuuuuuu....\" Its as though each letter of the word possessed its own syllable.\n\n\"...wwwiiilllllll NEVER, HA! NEVER, never...NEVER MIND! HAHAHAHAHAHA!\"\n\nStacy would have spoken up, and called him crazy, but that seemed utterly redundant.\n\nStacy finally reached his Over Sized Clown Chair, and Dialysis stopped moving for just one moment. He planted himself right at Stacy's feet and slowly moved his excuse for a head from one end of Stacy's body to the other. Stacy could finally peer through Dialysis' hair to find there were holes where eyes should have been.\n\n\"The women, ha!\" He could barely contain himself now.\n\n\"The women. The happy. And all between, are now, ha!\"\n\nThe chair reached out and swallowed Stacy whole. Every inch of his body melted into the fabric so he couldn't escape. Dialysis' raised his hands in the air like an epic conductor. Two needles, brimming with fire and tubing, snaked their way across the dungeon floor.\n\nOnce they reached Stacy's chair, Dialysis motioned for them to strike his arm with unrelenting force and pressure.\n\nStacy's head thrust back and his jaw jutted wide. Dialysis' mimed that he was zipping his lip, so each scream was muted before it could erupt.\n\nBecause Stacy possessed the knowledge that failure to comply would most certainly bring Death, he returned. Again. And again. And even again.\n\nAgain and again and again.\n\nAs weeks bled into years, Stacy learned to hide any minute indication that he was suffering. For he knew that made Dialysis happy.\n\nBut agonizing, in all its many human forms, has a way of devouring the adjectives that make us who we are.\n\nMiserable was most common. Evil, just as popular. Asshole was bandied about, but never fully adopted.\n\nBut if Dialysis' has one undeniable personality trait, its that he only pays attention to the negative. He relishes it. Bathes in it. Uses it for his own personal wiles.\n\nAnd that's where Stacy has the upper hand. You know, the one without the raping needles.\n\nFor unbeknown to Dialysis, Stacy the Downtrodden has reached a milestone of epic proportions.\n\nToday. Lovely today. Marvelous today.\n\nToday marks seven years on the UCSF Kidney Transplant List.\n\nWhen the phone call arrives, and it will any moment, Stacy will smile. The emotion from that moment will reach Dialysis' skin, and for once, he will burn. Every single pore on his body will jettison from his frame, screaming for mercy that will never arrive.\n\nStacy will fling his treatment blanket upon Dialysis's smoking corpse and announce one last decree:\n\n\"I'm taking applications for new adjectives. Anyone want to apply?\"\n\nMonday, January 10, 2011\n\nMy Soul, Is Bled\n\nMy Soul bleeds for Red Kisses from formidable women. The passionate kind you take to your grave.\n\nMy Soul bleeds of Childhood, once rich and fulfilling. Yanked from my existence with a diluted expression of nonchalance. The years stretch the moments, ignoring their intimacy, and unending value.\n\nMy Soul bleeds upon the Present, so stale and unaffected. Every moment a photo, faded with embers and dust. I desperately try to grasp them together, but they crumble through my fingers, forever gone.\n\nMy Soul bleeds Anger, thick, with resolve. For those who torment me with ignorant rantings, contained within their spews of verbal diarrhea.\n\nMy Soul bleeds through Needles, long and foreboding. My last resolve from the omnipresent Harbinger of Death.\n\nMy Soul bleeds Indignation for those festering with complacence. The ones who treat patients like pennies in fountains, disposable creatures tossed aside without care.\n\nMy Soul bleeds for the Future, so daunting, so uncertain, so mired, so true.\n\nWednesday, November 10, 2010\n\nHopefully Hopeful Hope\n\nHope can be a perilous thing.\n\nToo little, and Despair crawls out from the depths of your Soul and mires you downward.\n\nToo much, and you're a delusional fool.\n\nOn Tuesday, November 9th, I was invited to take a trip to the beating heart of the Bay Area, San Francisco. The UCSF Medical Center is roughly two miles southeast of Golden Gate Park.\n\nOnce inside, I made my way to the 7th Floor of 400 Parnassus Avenue. I took the stairs because elevators are home to body odors of unimaginable strength and duration.\n\nThe Surgeon, Social Worker, Financial and Transplant Coordinator's seemed pleased to see me.\n\nAfter six and a half years of Life Crushing Dialysis, Hope had made its presence known.\n\nI'm at the top of the UCSF Transplant Ready List. Fucking go time.\n\nWhen I arrived home later that day, I heard something whimpering in the far corner of my bedroom, under my Fortress of Solitude. (That's what I call my bed, for obvious reasons.)\n\nI knelt down and pulled back the comforter that was blocking my view underneath. My computer bag, duffel bag, and veteran backpack were all resting comfortably in their usual locations.\n\nBut the whimpering continued. Louder. Filled with suffering and pain.\n\nI moved my meager possessions aside and grabbed my portable flashlight. I had to find out what the hell was going on.\n\nHis eyelids cowered in the direct light. His body moved side to side abruptly, attempting to avoid the invasion.\n\nHe was a round little fuzzball, about the size of a regulation baseball. He appeared to be originally snow white, but years of neglect had darkened him with the dust and dank of time.\n\n\"Hey, I remember you,\" I said in my softest voice possible. \"Its okay. I promise I'll be nice.\"\n\nHis eyes widened and he turned his back to me. I hadn't been very kind to him in the past.\n\n\"Listen to me very carefully. I...won't...yell. I...promise.\"\n\nI reached my hand slowly under the bed and placed my palm upward. My fingers acknowledged it was okay to approach.\n\nFor what seemed like an eternity passed before he budged an inch. Trust was being formed, but it would take time.\n\nEventually, but slowly at first, he rolled his frail figure closer and closer to my hand.\n\nFinally, success.\n\nOnce in my hand, I could feel the caked on dirt. It smelled of neglect.\n\nI slowly brought him into the light. We smiled at one another. No other words needed to be spoken.\n\nHope was alive. Less than healthy, but alive nonetheless.\n\nAn hour later, Hope was on the top shelf of my bookcase with an incredible view of the room. I had gently, with great care, cleaned him. Before I was nearly done, he started to giggle. Apparently it tickled.\n\nSuddnely his face furrowed and he looked as though he might finally speak.\n\nHe wanted to know where I had been.\n\nThe story spewed out of me. Recklessly. Furiously. With abandon and hate.\n\nI spoke of Dialysis and His resurgence in my Life. His macaroni shaped body, covered in lesions and sores, had reappeared with a vengeance this past year.\n\nEach treatment was the same, creating a tapestry of woe and misery I keep to myself. Every evening, roughly an hour in, He would clamp down on my fistula with His razor sharp teeth and leave me blinded by insufferable pain.\n\nThere was no relief.\n\nIn times like these, Asshole Stacy resurfaces. He's not a pleasant guy. His weapons are words filled with vitriol and spite.\n\nMuch like a sobering drunk, once treatment ceases, he fades into the seams, apologetic and shamed.\n\nHe's the one that brings the Evil Thoughts.\n\nOver the years, I've experienced many, many comic books and superhero films.\n\nWhen I was a child, the division was so easy to understand. As a young boy, I rooted for the hero and pitied the villian. That was the way of things in my young, naive brain. I could never quite grasp how the antagonist could be so very bad.\n\nDialysis has taught me otherwise.\n\nI understand Evil. I've basked in its shadow and thrilled to its strength. It can be so very delightful in its unending machinations.\n\nBut here's where I'm fortunate.\n\nTrue Stacy was always nearby. Waiting. Watching. Pulling back when needed when Asshole Stacy was far too weak.\n\nThat's the only thing that saved me. My true Self. The Self from my memories from so long ago.\n\nFor some time, even before the call, True Stacy emerged. A joke here. Silliness there. The honest nature of True Stacy.\n\nAlthough these are momentary moments, for I tire so easily, they are welcome reminders that True Stacy has a chance.\n\nAs I used my flailing limbs and stomping feet to share this story with Hope, I finally felt that the stream had ceased. I plopped down in my office chair, exhausted and spent. I finally had the courage to look into the eyes of Hope.\n\nHope smiled back.\n\nI think I just might be okay."}

In June, rumors started circulating that ASUS was working on a smartwatch that would be low-cost and appealing to consumers. Now, according to quotes from Focus Taiwan, ASUS may launch its Android Wear device as soon as next month at IFA next month.\n\nASUS\u00a0CEO Jerry Shen told an investors\u2019 conference Tuesday that his company could debut its smartwatch as early as September at the IFA electronics trade show in Germany, with aggressive marketing efforts to promote the device.\n\nRead more\n\nSamsung and Apple will sew-up the smartwatch market, others will fail, predicts\u00a0analyst\n\n\nSamsung\u00a0and Apple\u00a0will largely own the smartwatch market between them, predicts\u00a0Jackdaw Research chief analyst Jan Dawson in a report being issued later today and seen by\u00a0Re/code.\n\nDawson said that new players should \u201cstay out of the market,\u201d and existing players should scale back their plans.\n\n\u201cWe do not recommend that existing vendors should maintain current levels of investment when market growth and the overall revenue opportunity remain poor,\u201d Dawson said. \u201cIt is unlikely that more than one or two small vendors will be able to make a sustainable business out of smartwatches in the face of competition from Samsung and [...]\u00a0Apple\u201d \u2026\n\nRead more\n\nAsus reportedly sold more tablets than Apple in Japan during first half of\u00a02014\n\nImage via TechSmartt\n\nImage via TechSmartt\n\nAccording to figures released by market research company BCN, Asus\u00a0sold more tablets than Apple during the first half of 2014 in Japan. Asus\u2019 market share rose 8 percent year-over-year during the first half of 2014, the report claims, giving it a 38.9 percent portion of the tablet market in Japan. Apple, on the other hand, holds a 36.4 percent share (via Nikkei). This is the first time Asus has ever held the top spot in Japan, according to the report.

One of the firms currently drafting up a plan is\u00a0Taiwanese computer manufacturer Asus, which will release a smartwatch sometime this fall, according to TechCrunch.

I am just learning, or trying to learn, programming. some other sites I've visited to research this shows using an ATMEGA 8 as a slave to the ATMEGA32 and with the MSGEQ7 to the ATMEGA8. could that work with this circuit and how?\ntriumphtotty (author) in reply to rrussis826 months ago\nI don't even think you would have to slave another chip. I've successfully interfaced a simple Op-Amp with a microphone to one of the ADC pins (AIN1 I think?). I think the biggest issue might be freeing up the control lines needed, as there are only a couple free in chr's design. Perhaps using a 3 to 8 decoder for the layer transistors on PC5-PC7, then PC0 and PC1 could control the RESET and STROBE lines on the MSGEQ7, and PC2 (AIN0) would read the analogue input from the OUT line?\nomid-el says: 6 months ago\nan other question my dear friend:\nhow can i change the text \"RR and \"LED CUBE\" to my own name or charachter.\ntriumphtotty (author) in reply to omid-el6 months ago\nShould be simple. Just look through launch_effect.c and modify the strings in there. chr has documented how to add extra effects to this too, in case you want to leave the current effects unchanged.\n\nGet More Out of Instructables\n\nAlready have an Account?\n\n\nPDF Downloads\n\nUpgrade to Pro today!"}

It's time to install it again.\nThanks for the pointer :)\n\nBring more content like this to bit-tech ;)\nZut 28th June 2006, 14:10 Quote\nSorry but I absolutely hated NWN. I played BG 1 & 2 and loved every nanosecond of it, but IMHO NWN lost every single drop of the charm and atmosphere that made BG great.\n\nThe graphics may have been quite good (at the time), but the gameplay was utterly awful and the plot and story elements were dull and painfully one-dimensional.\n\nI really really really hated it... sorry! :D\nRich_13 28th June 2006, 16:27 Quote\nI love it, used to play a mod server called crown of accension or something like that. was brilliant !\n\nHordes of the underdark was clearly the best solo play for me though. If you didn't like NWN just for the story then try that.\neddtox 28th June 2006, 17:22 Quote\nI still play NWN. I picked up a copy in a bargain basket a few months ago figuring its worth a try (\u00a33.99) and absolutely loved it. I love the fact that it has lasted more than 99.9% of games and you could probably spend your entire life playing user-made content after you play through the main campaign. I mean, how many games are still being patched and supported after 4 years? Definitely recommend it!\n\n-ed out\nsupermonkey 28th June 2006, 17:36 Quote\nI was just thinking about reinstalling this game today. One of my favorite things about NWN is the sheer amount of gameplay. With the core game and both expansions installed, you're looking at weeks of gameplay, if you choose to complete all the optional sidequests.\n\nThat alone makes it worth the money in my opinion. Well, that and the fact that it was just a blast to play. I don't know anyone around here who plays D&D, so I had to get my fill on the computer. NWN filled the void neatly.\n\nWhelan_999 28th June 2006, 17:50 Quote\nI used to play this game for hours and I never finished it, the game is Huge! Lots of stuff to do unlike games comming out today (HLE1) It's a great game and I might reinstall it soon.\nTulatin 28th June 2006, 18:10 Quote\nAh yeah, me and a friend spent literally weeks beating NWN + Expansions. While it did lose much of the charm from BG, it was hella fun, perhaps moreso than BG/II/IWD\ncaesarbear 29th June 2006, 00:47 Quote\nSome info on NWN and it's community\nNeverwinter primer:\n\nNeverwinter Nights (NWN) had two expansion packs, first Shadow of Undrentide (SoU), then Hordes of the Underdark (HotU).\nNWN Gold edition bundles NWN and SoU.\nNWN Platinum edition bundles NWN, SoU and HotU and is either CD or DVD.\nNWN Diamond edition bundles NWN, SoU, HotU, and 3 of the 4 current premium mods: Kingmaker, ShadowGaurd, Witch's Wake remake and is only DVD.\nNWN Kingmaker \"expansion\" bundles Kingmaker, ShadowGaurd, and Witch's Wake remake on CD.\nthe newest premium mods Pirates of the Sword Coast and Infinite Dungeons are only available by download.\n\nTo play a premium mod purchased through the BioWare Store requires an on-line verification just like attempting a multiplayer game.\n\nOC stands for Original (or Official) Campaign and refers to the campaign that came with the original release of NWN, the story involving the much discussed Aribeth. It is generally considered a mediocre campaign.\n\nThe popular character of Deekin is introduced halfway into the SoU campaign and can be your henchman. He also appears in HotU and again, can be your henchman.\n\nSoU and HotU are not sequels of the OC, although they do make reference to some of the events in the OC. SoU and HotU are very loosely tied together. There is a gap between a character's ending level of XP in SoU and the required starting level for HotU. HotU will instantly add the appropriate levels to your character or the XP gap can be \"filled\" by any mod(s). There are a few \"bridge\" modules specifically for this gap.\n\nA mod refers to a module, not a modification like other PC games. A module is the file that contains the area, dialog and script information for an adventure, and they are created using the Aurora toolset included with NWN.\n\nA hak is a file that contains custom content information like tilesets and models. In multiplayer the mod is only required on the server, but haks are required on the server and clients. Make sure you download any required haks before attempting to connect to an online or LAN server.\n\nCEP stands for Community Expansion Pack and is actually a very large hak. It includes a lot of content from many different haks into one hak file. It is endorsed by Bioware, but it is not maintained by Bioware. It is a must download since many mods now require it. download here\n\nMost mods and hak files as well as other files like custom portraits and scripts are located at IGN's Neverwinter Vault.\n\nPW stands for Persistent World. Sometimes also called Gameworlds, these popular on-line mods offer some of the features of old Multi-User Dungeons or Massively Multiplayer Online Roleplaying Games.\n\nThe Player Resource Consortium (PRC) pack is an additional package in the vein of CEP that adds a substantial amount of content for players including 75+ new player classes and prestige classes (PrC), 50+ sub-races, new spells, feats, etc. It is often used in PW settings but can be manually applied to compatible SP modules.\n\nNeverwinter Connections is a useful on-line mathcmaking service where you can find listings of PWs and Dungeon Master (DM) controlled games.\n\nother info links:\nKip's Guide to Neverwinter Nights\nDeth's guide to multiplayer\nNathrock\u0092s Unofficial Premium Content FAQ\nEasy fix to NWN Diamond edition and failing disk check\nNWNWiki project\n\nNWN2 is being developed by Obsidian (KotOR2, some former Black Isle devs) and is being co-produced by Atari and Bioware. It is planned for a later 2006 release. NWN1 mods will not be compatible.\ncaesarbear 29th June 2006, 00:56 Quote\nThe Top Rated list at IGN's NWVault contains some of the better community made mods available. There is a wide variety of content from roleplay to hack n' slash to unique experiences. Some mods exhibit very professional workmanship while others are rougher but offer inventive storytelling not generally available in mainstream RPGs. Although don't take the ranking order completely literally. The system is a bit flawed and cannot accurately rank order so many modules. You will continue to find excellent mods many pages deep. Often newer more seasoned worked is hidden below some older and highly popular work. It's more about your personal preference.\n\nHere's a list specifically designed to help players find modules to continue the career of one character: Berliad's Upper Level Module List\n\nSpecific top recommendations for anyone:\n\nStefan Gagne's ee1 - elegia eternum ee2 - excrucio eternum - a psychologically thrilling, roleplay heavy adventure series, and the HeX coda 01 - a unique and highly acclaimed Scifi/Fantasy adventure.\n\nMarc Price's trilogy of Midwinter Festival, Midsummer Knights' Dream, and Midnight Calling which will take a starting character to about 15th level.\n\nBaldecaran's compelling Cave of Songs and intricate Honor Among Thieves, my personal favorite.\n\nTortured Hearts - an epic for hard core cRPG gamers.\n\nTales of Arterra - The Lost and Tales of Arterra - The Awakening - finely crafted storytelling.\n\nThe Lord of Terror - The Diablo Campaign, Eye of the Beholder - the best of the remakes.\n\nRunes of Blood- featuring 100+ areas and hundreds of NPC, this is an excellent and epic module.\n\nThe Rose Of Eternity - Chapter 1 - The Coming - a console style RPG featuring some unique replayablility.\n\nAL1: Siege of Shadowdale, AL2: Crimson Tides of Tethyr - while the first part is a bit dated it leads to an excellent sequel.\n\nThe Aielund Saga Act I Act II Act III Act IV - an exciting series\n\nLegacy: Dark Moon Rising - A console style RPG with some of the best visuals by a NWN module.\n\nBlack Thorn - A unique mystery roleplay with randomly selected multiple endings. The clock is ticking in realtime and you must solve the puzzle in three hours.\n\nCormyrean Nights - an open adventure featuring a detailed living city.\n\nAdam Miller's Shadowlords series: 1 - The Message, 2 - Hill's Edge, 3 - Skull Gorge, 4 - Stonemeet, 5 - Enter the Shadow\nfollowed by Dreamcatcher series: 1 - Skyfall, 2 - Ocean Dreams, 3 - Pit of Stars, 4 - Evermeet\nand finally Demon\nGet them all in one bundled pack\n\nRTS - Harvest of Souls and Good vs Evil 2 - two excellent unique modules incorporating elements of RTS combat games and allowing teamplay.\nNoMercy 29th June 2006, 02:42 Quote\nI bought NWN as soon as it came out, both of the expansions on pre-order, and well, I met the love of my life while playing NWN, and I still play occasionally :)\n\nTruely one of the best games, ever... NWN2 has a lot to live up to.\ndraxar 29th June 2006, 03:47 Quote\nI remember NWN, it was really great for a long time, I spent hours and hours devoted to playing and leveling my characters.\n\nThough of course, now I've switched to Warcrack for that instead.\n\n<nostalgia>I was never really that fond of the expansion pack plots - I played through the original game, but never managed to finish either of the others. I think it was because at that point I'd found a great online Persistant World server called \"The Three Towns\" (aka 3T) that I was spending most of my time on.\n\nHaving checked it's webpage (going through three \"This site has moved\" messages from the first google result), apparently it's still going strong. I'd say it was one of the gem's the article describes - whenever I tried looking at other servers, my general reaction was that they were no-where near as good. Probably due to the fact that 3T realised that people are *******s and will powergame, and set the difficulty level based on that, and disabled much of the most abusable stuff. </nostalgia>\n\n<geek>Speaking of abuseable stuff, I wonder if they'll manage fix the game bugs in NWN2 that they never dealt with in NWN, like the monk attack stuff. Then again, NWN2 will probably use D&D 3.5 rules, neatly sidestepping that issue.</geek>\nJonDixon 30th June 2006, 20:42 Quote\nWell thank you bit-tech. After reading your Oblivion mods review last time I found myself instead installing Morrowind and the quite brilliant mods and retextures available for that.\n\nNow after reading your NWN mods , I am now splitting my time in two rpgs.\n\nWhats the next in the series? Freelancer? Because I'm just not sure I have the lifetime left needed to complete all these games\n\nKeep the series going, its great ressurecting the older games. Morrowind has been amazing to come back to after a few years. With all the graphic replacers/retextures, the better bodies, heads and clothing, enhanced music and sound effects. Nevermind the additional NPC's, Expanded Balmora and Children of Morrowind mods.\nolly_lewis 1st July 2006, 14:16 Quote\nNever played Neverwinter Night, is sort of passed me by, but this articles and the range of mods avalible had impressed me some what and I might see if I can bag a discount copy from the local GAME store.\nThe CEP mod pack looks great and interesting, but the Far Away server mod is one hell of a mod, its huge... But I doubt they would let me in, the registation process seems to be long winded and I doubt I would play the game for a very long length of time and not enough to merit trying to signup for the mod..\nBut there is always the sequel NWN2, have to get that when it comes out...\nParadigm Shifter 2nd July 2006, 19:44 Quote\nI didn't really like NWN... it was just too much of a departure from BG1&2, which were fantastic. I picked up SoU and HotU about a year ago (something like that) and really enjoyed those, though. May have to go have a look at the mods again...\n\n...I remember early on in NWN modding scene there was the start of a FFI total conversion... wonder how that got on?\n\nCool article.\ncaesarbear 6th July 2006, 04:58 Quote\nSome good new release suggestions:\n\nAL3: Tyrants of the Moonsea - Sequel to Siege of Shadowdale and Module of the Year - 2005 candidate Crimson Tides of Tethyr.

If that's the case, chances are you can't use it since it osunds like it needs some sort of online valedation.

{"dataman_score": 4.0, "text": "The Non-Open Book Exam\n\nIn law school almost all exams are open book, meaning that you can bring in anything you want to the exam short of another person. Some exams might be restricted open book exams where you may be able to bring in your own materials or your casebook but not any commercial outlines or anything else. Then there are two other species of exams: take home exams and closed-book exams. Both are deceptive creatures.\n\nIn my first year my constitutional law exam was a 48 hour take home exam. This year I have a 24 hour take home exam for one of my classes. Last year my professor told us that liked take home exams because he didn\u2019t want us to be writing under pressure and that he preferred reading answers that had been thought out rather than typed in three hours or so.\n\nWe didn\u2019t quite know what to do with our take home exam last year. Two days to answer three questions in 10 pages total. It seemed like a piece of cake. But no, there are one of two problems with a take home exam (or at least one that is more than 24 hours) that may afflict you.\n\nFirst, procrastination is the name of the game because there is no pressure to get it done in a short period of time. I\u2019ll do a little bit now and then a little bit later, you will tell yourself. Or, I have plenty of time to do this. Not so because the end of that 48 hours will arrive sooner than you think.\n\nSecond, you may find that you become disturbingly obsessed with your exam during the exam period. Perhaps I should be working on my exam instead of eating? What if everyone else is working on their exam right now and I\u2019m not? I need to re-write this section because it makes no sense. Oh wait, let me re-write it again, and so forth.\n\nThis year I also had a closed-book exam, meaning that we couldn\u2019t bring in anything except our computers and a pen into the exam. Law students have a tendency to faint at the mention of a closed-book exam because it means they can\u2019t have their security blanket with them (outlines, commercial outlines, case book, horn book, etc.). Note, you will soon find that law school is just like high school: mass hysteria runs rampant.\n\nBut it\u2019s really not so bad. Think about it: in high school and college you were never allowed to bring anything into an exam and you obviously survived that. You\u2019re typing for so long that you don\u2019t even really need your outline. Additionally, professors know that if you\u2019re not allowed to bring anything in they\u2019re not looking for you to be able to write about obscure little details (nor would they be for an open book exam).\n\nIn the end, an exam is an exam and you should probably try not worry about the format and concentrate instead on learning and applying the material."}

Broadband users tend to spend more time and money online, he said.\n\nEven those who recently said they saw no need for broadband are jumping to it now that prices are coming down.\n\nDwight Silverman | Techblogger, social media manager\n\n4 Responses\n\n  1. Lou Minatti says:\n\n    People are foolish not to get broadband now if it\u2019s available. I won\u2019t mention the names, but a well-known search provider and a famous phone company have teamed up to provide DSL for $14.95/mo. I use it, it works great. Why is anyone still paying for dialup? There is no longer any cost benefit to dialup, even if you use the Internet very infrequently.\n\n  2. mickster1245 says:\n\n    It has finally become reasonable so I\u2019m taking the leap. Will keep you informed.\n\n  3. RebeEllen says:\n\n    I wish someone (Dwight Silverman) or someone at the Chronicle would do the story about Time Warner Cable and their failure during \u201cHurricane Rita.\u201d\n\n    I use the quotes only because in my service area (Galleria area) I did not experience Hurricane Rita, yet Time Warner cable continues to blame Rita for all their troubles.\n\n    As an oldster who is not afraid to try new things, I signed up for the VOIP on Time Warner. It failed miserably during the \u201cstorm.\u201d Yes, I hesitate to even call what I experienced last Saturday morning a storm. The wind blew. Some limbs came down. The power went out for 20 hours \u2014 that I can understand. What I can\u2019t understand is why Time Warner Cable suffered such a loss and could not or would not handle it. My cable TV and VOIP modem didn\u2019t come back into service until Tuesday, yet the VOIP did not work. I had extreme difficulty reaching TWC and had to resort to visiting their lovely office on Bissonnett. Still didn\u2019t do any good. Broadband became intermittent on Wednesday evening after exchanging VOIP modem which took two additional trips to the office. TWC was still blaming Rita on Wednsiday night. Today, they had a new person to blame \u2014 ME! Amazing really. I\u2019ve changed nothing since last night but miraculously MY problem cured itself after I cancelled my broadband. HAH! Cable modem works beautifully now. And for all this TWC is going to give us ONE DAY CREDIT! Thanks a lot. As soon as the DSL modem arrives, I\u2019m done with TWC. Thanks to SBC, I had phone service working with a new number after placing my order just 5 hours earlier. Time Warner definitely needs some competition.\n\n  4. M'neeka says:\n\n    It\u2019ll have to come down lots farther for me to make the leap! I pay $4.95 for dial-up and spend a good 60 hours a week online. I also purchase roughly 90% of my non-grocery items online. Clearly, I\u2019m not negativley impacted by dial-up.\n\n    My first modem was 300 baud, run by a gerbil, a paperclip and piece of string. 56k is just fine by me!"}

There are 30 million Google hits for the phrase \u201claughter is the best medicine,\u201d an idea that dates at least as far back as Biblical times (Proverbs 17:22: \u201cA joyful heart is good medicine\u201d) but whose modern usage is commonly attributed to Henry Ward Beecher, the nineteenth-century abolitionist preacher who wrote, \u201cMirth is God\u2019s medicine\u2014everybody ought to bathe in it.\u201d\n\nBorn in 1813, Henry Ward Beecher was the eighth of thirteen children, two years younger than his sister Harriet Beecher Stowe. In America, first-born and only children are more likely to earn six-figure incomes and hold top executive positions. Catharine, the oldest sibling of the Beecher family, was engaged to a Yale mathematician who died in a shipwreck. After his death, she founded five women\u2019s colleges and published dozens of books on the importance of education, but never believed that women should have the vote.\n\nHenry Ward Beecher is said to have had \u201ca passion for jewels, which he carried, unset, in his pockets, taking them out for comfort when he was tired or in low spirits.\u201d Other animals that hoard shiny objects include raccoons, crows and magpies. \u201cI know every single thing that I have. My photographic memory is getting better,\u201d said Lindsay Lohan in a 2010\u00a0interview with The Insider that aired with the title \u201cCelebrity Hoarder.\u201d In 2011, Lohan was\u00a0court-mandated to complete an anti-shoplifting class after she was caught stealing from a jewelry store. Magpies were once thought to be omens of the devil; in nineteenth-century England, the superstitious would salute a magpie when they saw it, then turn around in a circle three times.\n\nMagpies mate for life. Black vultures also mate for life, discouraging infidelity by attacking\u00a0members of their community who are caught cheating in public. In 1875, Henry Ward Beecher underwent a six-month public trial for adultery after being accused of having an affair with a married woman at his church. Last year, Lindsay Lohan made $300,000 for portraying Elizabeth Taylor over the course of her most public affair. Leviticus 20:10 says, \u201cIf a man commits adultery with the wife of his neighbor, both the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death.\u201d After his reputed mistress was excommunicated from the church, Henry Ward Beecher continued to command thousands of worshipers each week at the Plymouth Church in Brooklyn. Today, a third of Americans believe that every word of the Bible is literally true.\n\nOn average, public speakers out-laugh their audiences by around 50 percent. However, gender makes a big difference in these statistics: on average, when a woman speaks to a female audience, she laughs 70 percent more than her listeners do; she laughs twice as often when speaking to a room of men. When a man speaks to men, he laughs 20 percent more than his audience. When he speaks to women, he is out-laughed by 8 percent.\n\nLaughter is healthy, but its benefits may also extend to other, similar activities. \u201cIt\u2019s not really clear that the effects of laughter are different from screaming,\u201d said a neuroscientist at the University of Maryland. In 1962, three girls at a missionary-run boarding school in modern-day Tanzania began laughing and couldn\u2019t stop. Their symptoms spread to the majority of the pupils at the school and then to the surrounding villages. Over the next year, 14 schools were shut down and thousands were reported as affected by this epidemic, which \u201chad nothing to do with humor,\u201d according to a Purdue linguist. \u201cThere was no merriment,\u201d he added. \u201cThere is no specific cause.\u201d\n\n\nJia Tolentino\u00a0lives in Ann Arbor.

{"dataman_score": 4.0, "text": "Synchronicity: Or\u2026The Occult, Daniel Pinchbeck and\u00a0Me\n\nLike many others, I occasionally watch The Colbert Report. The other night, he interviewed a guy named Daniel Pinchbeck. This may shock some of the literati and hipster types out there, but I\u2019d never heard of him before. Obviously he was promoting his new book, 2012: The Return of Quetzalcoatl, in which he claims to be in communication with ancient Mesoamerican Gods and sees powerful hallucinogens as a route to a new harmonic consciousness. Apparently, judging by some early reviews, the main thrust of the book is apocalyptic. Like a perfect neo-romantic archetype out of Charles Taylor\u2019s Sources of the Self, Pinchbeck perceives modern rational capitalist and materialist values as the problem, and encourages shamanic (his word), intuitive and instinctual ways of seeing the world. He is searching for alternate states of consciousness, and also heavily advocates the use of drugs as a means to achieve these states. He appears like a fusion of Carlos Castaneda, Timothy Leary, Oswald Spengler and Woody Allen.\n\nHe\u2019s an occultist, of course, and has written about alchemy and magic. Further, he\u2019s participated in primitive rituals involving transcendental states in Africa and South America, and explored the modern manifestations of mysticism and shamanism at the Burning Man festival in the Nevada desert. Judging by some of his written work (including a host of articles in Artforum), he has also extensively studied the eddies and backwaters of the Western tradition. He is, for lack of a better term, a student of the weird.\n\nI, too, am a student of the weird. Actually, I\u2019m not just a student \u2014 more a historian (as the chair of my old department once said\u2026\u201dthe weird needs its historian\u201d). The deep tradition of Western mysticism and other associated alchemies is familiar to me: The Hermetic Corpus; Asclepius and Hermes Trismegistus; the eleusinian mysteries; Zoroastrianism, Manicheanism and Gnosticism; Plotinus, Iamblichus and the Islamic neoplatonists; early Kabbalists; the Albigensians, Cathars and Knights Templar; the mythical medieval alchemist Basilius Valentinus; renaissance thinkers like Pico della Mirandola, Ficino and the Florentine academy; Paracelsus and Van Helmont; Giordano Bruno; John Dee and Robert Fludd; the Rosicrucians (and Descartes); Newton (and his obsession with alchemy); Louis Claude de St. Martin, Swedenborg and Mesmer; the Illuminati and Adam Weishaupt; freemasonry; Eliphas Levi; the symbolists and Gerard de Nerval; Aleister Crowley and the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn; Arthur Edward Waite; Madame Blavatsky, Theosophy and Rudolf Steiner; Wilhelm Reich and the Orgone, etc, etc\u2026\n\nThis, however, is a more historical mode than I believe Pinchbeck operates in. His is a thoroughly modern cosmology shaped by the influence of \u201cscientific\u201d symbolism in the occult, a world colored by skepticism and doubt. The twentieth century path is a winding one. The odd amalgam between the physical and psychic sciences and the rise of holistic thinking (something Pinchbeck is also clearly tapped into) in the interwar years were merely seeds which germinated in the dark and shady soil of the Cold War, mutating into new political and cultural forms: paranoia, \u201calien-nation\u201d, mind control, the CIA and LSD. This last is somewhat rescued and saved, oddly, by one of Pinchbeck\u2019s major influences, the drug-guru himself, Timothy Leary. Still, the dark corners of the post-war American esoteric scene (cf. Anton LaVey) are clearly not alien to him\u2026\n\nAnd, of course, neither are aliens. Pinchbeck is deeply immersed in what I can only call the X-Files cosmology (UFOs, little green men, crop circles, cryptozoology, alien abductions, etc\u2026). I suspect this is born of a close reading of the cyberpunk/cyberculture scene, with a little of Jung\u2019s Flying Saucers thrown in for good measure. For him, I\u2019m sure some of the c-punks were mystics in mirrorshades. No wonder, since this whole fringe theory edge-of-science, pseudo-science world is rife with esoteric speculation and bad behavior. Among the golden age writers like Asimov, Heinlein and Bradbury, the father of Scientology, L. Ron Hubbard, was just a hack. \u2018Nuff said.\n\nTruth is, the history of medicine and science, taken from a certain point of view, is an avenue into all these fascinating esoteric currents, and is the one I took. Pinchbeck sounds conversant with these themes too, speaking of the scientific enterprise like a careful reader of Feyerabend\u2019s Against Method. He sees science as merely one form of myth-making among many. In an essay in Artforum on an obscure early 20th century Italian occultist named Julius Evola, Pinchbeck \u2014 in a moment of arrogant elitism \u2014 notes that Evola\u2019s \u201c\u2026perspective will only make sense for those who have discovered for themselves that the scientific rationalism of our materialist age is not the whole story.\u201d Really? Who knew.\n\nAnd yet he adds a level of crazed and earnest lunacy to his claims, pushing ontology well beyond the bounds most philosophers of science would be comfortable with. As one commentator notes, Pinchbeck \u201couted himself as a crazy fool.\u201d Their discomfort, like anyone in academia who tries to push boundaries, is invariably a function of their need to concern themselves with tenure-review boards and other forms of censure and gatekeeping. Pinchbeck comes to the occult from the more direct route \u2014 as a writer, a bohemian, an outsider and an intellectual. No wonder, given his background.\n\nJudging by his biographical details, the Beats were clearly in his blood. His mother dated Jack Kerouac and is a writer and poet in her own right. Pinchbeck\u2019s parents were part of an \u201coutsider elite,\u201d and, perhaps not surprisingly, he doesn\u2019t seem to have rebelled all that much. In this sense, Pinchbeck\u2019s experientialist ideology, and his willingness to let his freak-flag fly, is old news. Colin Wilson\u2019s book The Outsider, written in the mid-1950s, provides an archetype that would require little tailoring to fit Pinchbeck.\n\nThe article written about him in Rolling Stone portrays a character I can well imagine having met a hundred times hanging out at the university or the newest hipster bar on the main. His is a circle of Brooklynites who are, superficially at least, little different from the people I know. Disgruntled intellectuals, some pseudo, some not so pseudo, soured and aging graduate students in a race against advanced alcoholism, flakes of all description really.\n\nThe difference is that his scene is New York, and it\u2019s the U.S., not Montreal, an aging French provincial outpost turned city of sin out on the very periphery of the empire. Pinchbeck is the most high-end form of scenester there is, pitching his own brand of drug \u2014 Dimethyltryptamine (DMT), a powerful hallucinogen that provides the out-of-body experience he uses for his shamanistic travels \u2014 and trying to get in the pants of any pretty girl that will give him the time of day.\n\nPinchbeck, you see, is a bit of a notorious letch. This born perhaps of his early life as a big nerd \u2014 playing chess and dungeons and dragons before he finally broke through to new horizons. The man is notorious for badgering, begging and whining until girls eventually capitulate to his \u201ccharm\u201d. Here he and I differ significantly. He wrote an article in Esquire, for example, entitled \u201cHey Mister, Can You Dunk\u201d about his experiences learning to play basketball properly in his late 20s! I was always more of a jock than that, and at 16 and 17 used to play pick-up basketball all over the city with guys twice my age. Pinchbeck and I definitely grew up on very different sides of the tracks and his effete qualities are the kind of thing that would have gotten me in more trouble than I was willing to fight my way out of. That is if it ever occured to me to act that way.\n\nPerhaps this is the seminal difference between Pinchbeck\u2019s somewhat fraudulent, self-aggrandizing, media-hungry approach, heavily immersed in a discourse of hedonism, literary elitism and egotism and my more hermetic and stoic search for meaning. I don\u2019t have Pinchbeck\u2019s melodramatic flair, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019d want it either.\n\nTruth is, occult and esoteric knowledge has always been peddled by charlatans, montebanks and frauds of all description and in this regard the 21st century is no different. Anyway, Pinchbeck\u2019s overall message is important \u2014 and one that may be crucial to our physical and psychic survival as a species. Here I do agree with Pinchbeck, who, in one of his essays, quotes Malraux to get his essential sentiment across, writing that \u201cThe twenty-first century will be mystical, or it will not be.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Mr. Pinchbeck, indeed.\n\n11 Responses to \u201cSynchronicity: Or\u2026The Occult, Daniel Pinchbeck and\u00a0Me\u201d\n\n  1. Tim Says:\n\n    I\u2019m not actually sure Pinchbeck would consider himself an \u201coccultist\u201d per se, based on what I\u2019ve read and interacted with him. But that\u2019s a probably pointless distinction based on what you\u2019re trying to say here\u2026\n\n  2. kimber the wolfgrrrl Says:\n\n    When it comes to Pinchbeck, I\u2019ll give him a few more years before I take him too seriously. There are far too many hucksters in this line of study who quest after knowledge for the reflected mystique, in the hopes of getting a bit of sugar on the side, wink wink nudge nudge. No one\u2019s motives are pure, surely, but I\u2019ll let the test of time galvanize his theories and lend credence to his opinions. :)\n\n    Interesting post! I\u2019ll most certainly be back to check out more.\n\n  3. MN Says:\n\n    We met him yesterday and he was a total prick to us and his audience. He actually chased someone down and asked them if they wanted his autograph. Unfortunately, his rock star status went to his head, and that really sucks because so much of what he has to say is valuable. I won\u2019t be wasting my time, energy, or money on him again.\n\n  4. The Necromancer Says:\n\n    Hmmm\u2026His message is important\u2026The delivery, on the other hand\u2026You could get much of what he says from a critical (radical?) vision of the history of science (e.g. Caroline Merchant\u2019s The Death of Nature), but with a softer touch. Then again, without the rock star approach, it may never reach a wider audience\u2026\n\n  5. Notes on Mind Control \u00ab The Necromancer Says:\n\n    [...] of a positive slant, too, if you followed the LSD line along the psychedelic path to Leary and even Pinchbeck). To get budding researchers started, I\u2019ve proposed a brief bibliography (with [...]\n\n  6.

Through doing that I managed to get good real work during this recession with an Undergrad in Music of all things. Aparently business people like musicians. Anyway, no one is perfect. When you are in the public eye, many of your personal faults are revealed. I am sure most of you have social quirks that if you were being intensely analyzed 24/7 people would think poorly of you as well. I have met Daniel several times but mostly I kept quiet while around him because I have known a few successful musicians in my life and the last thing a public person wants to hear about in private are things that they\u2019ve put their soul into and spent many years of their life completely dedicated to the work involved. I have never personally seen Daniel do anything socially disturbing but I have often heard about it, I honestly like to keep to my own personal business and try to work out my own many faults. I don\u2019t quite understand his sexuality but for some reason people seem to think it is important. I read somewhere in my internet procrastination at work that he had a spinal problem as a young man and had to be in the hospital for at least a year. Also note that there is a lot of social pressure in NYC to be cool, to fit in, dress right, and get laid.\n\n    Maybe this is the hypocracy that people are trying to point out. While he talks about improving the self to improve life around you, he is not making leaps and bounds in his public sexual personna. Working with him and the rest of the \u201cscene\u201d has been interesting and challenging. I think the term \u201cscenester\u201d or \u201chipster\u201d is prevalant in being involved with these people but not the point whatsoever. That is actually a really old term, I\u2019ve heard my dad talk about hipsters when he lived in new york. The term is so vague, you could call a person who has absolutely no interest in esoterica but is really into fashion a hipster. I think the term should be avoided because it is a judgement made almost fully on the outer core, visual, or material of a person. For that matter a persons sexual failures really doesn\u2019t have much to do with their academic achievement or quality of their work. Who cares if he\u2019s a egomaniacal, hipocritical, elitist! He wrote a book that made you think, become interested, and learn for yourself and that is quite an achievement.\n\n  9. The Necromancer Says:\n\n    You make very valid points. Nobody\u2019s perfect. Actually, I think 2012: The Return of Quetzalcoalt is well-written and wide ranging. But it\u2019s nothing that Castaneda didn\u2019t do with more texture, humility and soul.\n\n    I understand the pressures of celebrity. They are, I suspect, similar to pressures we all have \u2014 to fit in, get laid, be cool. Yet there is a contradiction between his behavior and his beliefs, I think. And this isn\u2019t necessarily about sex. Who among us is Sir Percival? More about ontology, I guess.\n\n    You are a bit of a booster for the Pinchbeck cause. That\u2019s fine. All I offer is criticism (which happens to come up first in a Goggle search\u2026). There are other voices in this chorus too. There will be more when the full pop culture impact of his ideas becomes more prevalent.\n\n    I\u2019m not really trying to psychoanalyze Pinchbeck. He does that well himself. If anything, I think he prompts self-reflection. And some intriguing possibilities\u2026\n\n    Heck, I\u2019m a couple of years younger than the guy and what have I done? He\u2019s tremendously productive, successful and talented. How can you fault him beyond asking bigger questions about his ideas and life?\n\n    Which is what I have tried to do\u2026\n\n  10. Justin Says:\n\n    I read this guy\u2019s first book and he smelled like a hack from page two. The New Age movement is wrought with narcissism and people wanting to cash in on indigenous knowledge \u2014 financially as well as spiritually \u2014 strip mining various cultures for the purposes of evading their own personal crises of meaninglessness.\n\n    Meaninglessness is key here because New Agers\u2019 quest is not to understand the world as it is, but to develop their own egos. It is a fascination with self-identity and a path to weekend warriorship, a way to bliss out on nature \u2014 without dealing with the hardship, disease, famine and intense physical labor at the whim and mercy of an unforgiving as well as bountiful Earth. New Agers forget that the hardship, scarcity, lack \u2014 these \u201cbummer\u201d emotions influenced the \u201cEarth honoring\u201d rituals and beliefs they have stolen from Native Peoples at least as much as the positive ones.\n\n    New York hipsters don\u2019t know lack, scarcity or hardship. Not getting laid by a different girl every night is not hardship. My problem with Pinchbeck\u2019s writing is not whether or not he is an arrogant prick, but whether or not he has anything real or true to say. I am convinced that he does not. He\u2019s just another Western tourist with a big mouth and nothing substantive to original to say about his acidhead experiences.\n\n    Castenada was the Grandmaster Pimp Daddy of using his bullshitting talents to con, seduce, and shamelessly exploit others\u2013especially women. But at least it can be said he did it with more charm, and so convincingly that he fooled the UCLA anthro department into just handing him a Ph.D for writing a novel! Pinchbeck can\u2019t even manage to pull the wool over the NYT Sunday Book Review! Castaneda was a great storyteller, a genius in fact. It took months of scholarly work and literature review to dig up all the source material for his fantastic stories.\n\n    Yet, people were hurt by the lies and hurt by their own self-deceptions required to buy into the bullshit in the first place. We don\u2019t need shamanism to show us how to do it. Nobody needs a guru to tell them how it is. Everyone is smart enough to discover (not manufacture) meaning for themselves. Unfortunately, most people are too intellectually and spiritually lazy and would happily tug like a child on the coatsleeves of the leading narcissists of our age, begging them for all the answers.\n\n    We don\u2019t need an irrelevent psuedo-Maya apocalypse to inspire us to live better, let alone a million hacks\u2019 crackpot analyses of said psuedo-apocalypse. I\u2019ve never sat down and said, \u201cGosh, I sure wish I had a better cultural meme to help me figure it all out.\u201d\n\n    The minute we let go of trying to enhance, develop, study, identify and search out meaning for \u201cme\u201d the moment these quests seem like fools\u2019 errands and we can look at life around us without the slimy shellac of dogma and theory that coats every hungry, misguided desire for meaning.\n\n  11. The Necromancer Says:\n\n    Wow. This is some cold-forged, high-grade criticism, bro. I can\u2019t say I don\u2019t disagree with you about the finer points of this pointed rant. I might be inclined to give Castenada more credit than you do here, especially since I find him to be a pretty high-caliber writer and communicator.\n\n    But as to the rest, the New Age is, as usual, in a constant state of crisis. What passes for real transgressive thought is instantaneously absorbed by the status quo, used to sell and market and aggrandize by those who wish to be aggrandized.\n\n    It\u2019s a tough sell, but maybe that\u2019s the problem \u2014 people ought to stop selling (or consulting, as they call it) and start living\u2026\n\nLeave a Reply\n\n\nWordPress.com Logo\n\n\nTwitter picture\n\n\nFacebook photo\n\n\nGoogle+ photo\n\n\nConnecting to %s\n\n\nGet every new post delivered to your Inbox.\n\nJoin 883 other followers\n\n%d bloggers like this:"}

Lactose Overload?\n    Hello All,\n    This is my 1st post so please excuse me if I ramble.\n    Here's the thing-\n    My DD is now 12 weeks old. When she was born I had severe nipple cracks, bleeding etc and hence began to express and feed. We couldn't hack it with the cup/ spoon/ dropper and so finally succumbed to the bottle (terrible, right?).I started getting better and gradually put her back on to the breast. We had/have latch problems etc but about 6 weeks ago I switched her entirely onto the breast. She would be there all day! I guess the latch and positioning was still ineffective.\n    A few days after we started EBFing, her poop became runny and got progressively worse. Took her to two docs and finally, after a lot of testing and an entire course of antibiotics (said it was a viral intestinal infection), they both thought she should be taken off the breast (temporary Lactose Intolerance) and fed with Soy based Formula!!!!!!!\n    Finally after about 7 days on Soy (she had 1 toothpaste consistency, yellow ochre Bowel Movement a day) one of the doctors(the one we stuck with) said to reintroduce BM alternating with Soy. s\\Since then, She goes once a day and has this strange part toothpaste part liquidy yellowish/ greenish EXTREMELY foul smelling poop.\n    What do i do? What is wrong? Have read tonnes about Secondary Lactose intolerance, Lactose Overload and proper latching techniques but I am still throughly confused as to how to address this situation. Please Please help. Thanks!\n\n  2. #2\n    Join Date\n    May 2006\n\n    Default Re: Diarrhoea- Infection?Lactose Intolerance? Lactose Overlo\n\n    Welcome to the forum!\n\n    Can you describe the poops that made you worry so much that you took the baby to the doc? Were they green? Bloody? Mucousy? Explosive? Was baby's weight gain normal during the period in which she was exclusively breastfed? Did you feel like you were coping with a milk oversupply?\n\n    The reason I ask is that in a baby who is growing normally and is otherwise healthy, weird looking/smelling poops are generally nothing to worry about, and not a reason to switch to formula.\n\n    At this point, some weird-looking poops are to be expected. The ochre toothpaste poop is formula. Yellowish-greenish liquidy poop is breastmilk. The foul-smelling part... Well, it could be the formula. Formula poop smells nasty compared to the average breastmilk poop. But if your baby has a lactose overload thing going on, then yucky smells are probably part of that package.\n\n    So if your baby still has some sort of lactose overload issue going on, then is that a health problem? As long as your baby isn't suffering from congenital lactose intolerance (which rare and is a real health problem) or other metabolic disorder (see this link: http://kellymom.com/health/baby-heal...e-intolerance/), then the weird poops may be something you just put up with. My second kid struggled with lactose overload from my extremely abundant milk supply, and she had consistently green, occasionally blood-streaked/specked poop from about 3 weeks until around 6 months. But she grew and developed completely normally, no formula needed.\n    Last edited by @llli*mommal; November 1st, 2012 at 06:40 AM.\n\n  3. #3\n    Join Date\n    Jun 2009\n\n    Default Re: Diarrhoea- Infection?Lactose Intolerance?

They are supposed to be....\n\n    Are you breastfeeding now? Does it still hurt you?

{"dataman_score": 4.0, "text": "Amateur radio callsigns of the Middle East\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\nJump to: navigation, search\n\nAmateur radio or ham radio call signs are unique identifiers for about 9,100 licensed operators in the Middle East. Call signs are regulated internationally by the International Telegraph Union (ITU) and nationally by local government and international agencies in Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, The Palestine Authority, occupied territories and other nations or DXCC entities. Since callsign allocation from the ITU is administered by national political authorities and international mandates, it is a story of transition, compromise, and internationally unrecognized operation to follow the history of such allocations in the 20th century in this area.[1]\n\nCall sign blocks for telecommunication[edit]\n\nThe ITU has assigned countries in the Middle East the following call sign blocks for all radio communication, broadcasting or transmission:[2]\n\nCall sign block DXCC Entity Apprx. # hams[3]\nA4A-A4Z Oman 170\nA6A-A6Z United Arab Emirates 64\nA7A-A7Z Qatar 65\nA9A-A9Z Bahrain 23\nEPA-EQZ, 9B-9D Iran 4(?)\nE4A-E4Z Palestinian Authority 28\nHZA-HZZ, 7Z, 8Z Saudi Arabia 560\nJYA-JYZ Jordan (Hashemite Kingdom of) 92\nOD5AA-OD5ZZ Lebanon 23\nSUA-SUZ, 6A-6B, SSA-SSM Egypt 113\nTAA-TCZ, YMA-YMZ Turkey 4,689\nYKA-YKZ, 6CA-6CZ Syria 30\nZC4 Cyprus, UK Sovereign Base Area 52\n4XA-4XZ, 4ZA-4ZZ Israel 2,135\n5B, C4, H2, P3, P3\u00d8, P36 Cyprus, Republic of 643\n7OA-7OZ Yemen Republic 13\n9KA-9KZ Kuwait 240\n\nThe DXCC deleted entities list notes that for the British Protectorate prefix of ZC6 and the Palestine prefix of 4X1, only contacts made June 30, 1968, and before, count for Palestine as an entity. Contacts made July 1, 1968, and after, count as Israel (4X).[4]\n\n4W used to be a prefix for Yemen, but only contacts made May 21, 1990, and before, count for this entity. With the merger of North and South Yemen, only \"7O\" is used. However, amateur operation from this entity is extremely rare.\n\nWhile not directly related to call signs, the ITU further has divided all countries assigned amateur radio prefixes into three regions; the Middle East is located in ITU Region 1. It is assigned ITU Zone 39 with Egypt being mainly in ITU Zone 38 and Iran in ITU Zone 40, and CQ Zones 20 & 21 with Egypt mainly in CQ Zone 34.\n\nHistory of call sign allocation[edit]\n\nThe callsign allocation history of this region is complex and follows the political interests of various countries who exercised political control in the region. It also changed in relation to various independence movements, particularly following World War II.\n\nHowever, as early as 1931 the prefix \"AP\" (i.e., for Asia/Pacific) arose for the region. Today that is used for Pakistan.\n\nBefore 1945 the prefixes ZC1 and ZC6 were used for Transjordan and Palestine respectively, still seen as a British Protectorate.\n\nInternational Radiotelegraph Conferences[edit]\n\nThe conference held in 1927 assigned call prefixes to Persia (RVA-RVZ), Egypt (SUA-SUZ), Turkey (TAA-TCZ), and Iraq (YIA-YIZ). These, however, did not necessarily include amateur radio operation.[5] Middle East areas administered politically by mandated countries (i.e., Great Britain's mandate over Palestine) adopted call sign regulations of those entities.\n\nThe 1947 Atlantic City ITU Conference reallocated call sign blocks to Iraq (HNA-HNZ, YIA-YIZ), Egypt (SSA-SUZ), Turkey (TAA-TCZ, YMA-YMZ), and to British Colonies and Protectorates (ZBA-ZJZ, ZNA-ZOZ, ZQA-ZQZ, and 4PA-4SZ). The United Nations was assigned 4UA-4UZ which sometimes was used in the Middle East.[6]\n\nCyprus, including UK Sovereign Base Areas and northern Cyprus[edit]\n\nThe island of Cyprus includes two DXCC entities as well as one other recognized only by the government of Turkey.\n\nThe Republic of Cyprus became independent from Great Britain in 1960. It has de jure governance over most of the island of Cyprus, except for the United Kingdom Sovereign Base Areas (SBA) of Akrotiri and Dhekelia in the south and east of the island. The Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus is a self-proclaimed state on the part of the island occupied by Turkey. This situation came about after a Turkish invasion of the island in 1974 and a unilateral declaration of independence for the north in 1983. The international community, including the United Nations and the European Union, recognises the de jure sovereignty of the Republic of Cyprus over the entire island, less the SBAs.\n\nThe ITU has assigned \"5B\", \"C4\", \"H2\" and \"P3\" prefixes to the Republic of Cyprus. As the SBAs are not under the sovereignty of Cyprus, Great Britain assigns the pre-1960 colonial call sign prefix \"ZC4\" to roughly 50 amateur radio operators in the SBAs.\n\nNorthern Cyprus uses the prefix block of \"1BA-1BZ\", which has not been allocated by the ITU,[7] for its radio operation. There is regular tension with the block's use, especially for visitors to the north who sign with a \"1B/\" prefix. Operators in the south tell them to use \"5B/\".[8]\n\n\nWhat is known today as Syria was part of the Ottoman Empire until World War I. In 1920 it became a League of Nations French Mandate, which included Lebanon. Syria became republic in 1946 with France's withdrawal.\n\nIntermediate callsign prefixes of \"AR\" were available to amateurs in the region until after World War II. In 1949 the Syrian Amateur Radio League was formed and YK1 was adopted as the Syrian prefix. Syria has made use of the \"6C\" prefix for special events. United Nations peacekeepers in the border area with Israel have used their callsigns with a \"/YK\" added.\n\nPalestine and Transjordan/Jordan[edit]\n\nCallsigns until 1945 were split between ZC1 for Transjordan and ZC6 for Palestine, as part of Great Britain's scheme for overseas radio. All the stations belonged to members of the British Forces. Palestine counted as a separate DXCC country for contacts made until June 30, 1968, as the British still granted licences mainly to their own nationals. After the creation of the State of Israel, UN Headquarters retained the use of the ZC6 prefix with station ZC6UNJ at the Jerusalem headquarters.\n\nJordan changed to the JY prefix under the use of British personnel in the area. King Hussein in the 1950s was an amateur radio operator and popularized the use of the JY1 prefix for foreigners and citizens following the British exodus from the region.\n\nPalestine was added to the DXCC List under paragraph b) effective 1 October 1999, with start date of 1 February 1999. The only prefix acceptable is E4 since the call-sign group ZC6 is registered for Great Britain and its overseas possessions. Under the DXCC rules, contacts with the deleted entity of Palestine made prior to June 30, 1968 do not count for this entity. There is no commonality of territory or administration. E4 is in WAZ Zone 20, ITU Zone 39.[9]\n\n\nThe September before the creation of the State of Israel, the station ZC6AA identified its location as \"Tel Aviv, Israel.\" [10]\n\n4X and 4Z were activated when the state of Israel was proclaimed, however afterwards some individual operators adopted call signs assuming that the territory was still \"Arab Palestine\". The UN Headquarters signed \"Jerusalem\" in 1947 and \"Jerusalem, Palestine\" in 1957, with callsigns ZC6UNJ and ZC6UNU.\n\nDuring the Suez crisis in 1957, some Israeli operators signed in the Sinai with an Israelis prefix, but with a /SINAI appended to their call sign.\n\nIsrael can issue a National Israeli call sign in the series 4Z8 to foreign amateurs whose countries participate in the CEPT Recommendation T/R 61-02.\n\nThe Israeli Amateur Radio Club (IARC) was founded on February 18, 1948, and is a member at IARU.[11] Presently call signs are issued within Israel by the Ministry of Communications according to this table:\n\nCall sign block License Category\n4X\u00d8, 4Z\u00d8, 4X2, 4Z2, 4X3, 4Z3, 4X5, 4Z6, 4X7, 4X9 Special Events\n4X1AA-4X1ZZ, 4Z1AA-4Z1ZZ Extra/Class A\n4X4AA-4X4ZZ, 4Z4AA-4Z4ZZ, 4Z5AA-4Z5ZZ, 4X6AA-4X6ZZ General/Class B\n4Z9AAA-4Z9ZZZ Novice/Class C\n4Z7AAA-4Z7ZZZ Technician/Class D\n4X8AA-4X8ZZ Honorary\n4Z8AA-4Z8ZZ Foreign\n\nIn July 2012 a 4Z5 operator was upgraded to class A without a callsign change.\n\n\nGaza became part of the British Mandate following World War I. After the 1948 Arab/Israeli war Gaza was administered by Egypt, but was captured by Israel in the 1967 war. In 1993 the area was transferred to the Palestinian National Authority. After Egypt's loss of Gaza to Israel in 1967, amateur radio operation by civilians was generally forbidden. UN stations sometimes added \"/4U\" to their national call signs and one added the British Protectorate prefix \"/ZC6\" to his.\n\nOn 2 December 1994 the Palestine Authority for Gaza and Jericho issued the call-signs to Palestine nationals, ZC6A to Ali Yashruti and ZC6B to Dr. Sama Tarazi (previously KF2GJ) who ran a short operation from the Gaza strip, using the historic call sign ZC6B. Designations used by foreigners have been /GAZA and /ZC6 following their own national call signs. This practice continued until as late as 2001.\n\nIn 1999 Palestine was allocated the E4 block of call signs and the Palestine Authority granted visitor licenses. Some Hungarian and Japanese nationals used /E4 following their call signs from that date.\n\nIn October 2012, an E40 call was issued to a Gaza ham who calls on the Jerusalem (Israel Amateur Radio Club) R1 repeater. Since that call was already issued by the Palestinian Authority to a Russian DX'er, as of early December 2012 he started using E44M. He was off the repeater during most of November 2012 due to obvious reasons.\n\n\nAmateur radio in Lebanon is governed by the Ministry of Telecommunications including the Ministry of Defense- Intelligence Unit and Ministry of Transport-Civil aviation.[12] Reciprocal and temporary licenses are offered in Lebanon by the Ministry of Telecommunications on a case by case basis, as Lebanon has no agreements with any other country.\n\nThe ITU assigns the call sign block ODA-ODZ to Lebanon. Until the mid-1950s amateurs there operated with an AR8 prefix.\n\nSaudi Arabia[edit]\n\nSaudi public amateur radio licensing commenced in 2004, as the Saudi Communications and Information Technology Commission took over regulation within the HZ, 7Z and 8Z ITU call sign area. Foreign hams before then could operate from club stations, like the Dhahran Amateur Radio Club (HZ1AB).[13]\n\nHZ1AB was originally the United States Military Training Mission and the station formally closed in 2004. The call sign is now issued to a Saudi national.\n\nAfter deregulation, there are now about 500 licensed radio amateurs in Saudi Arabia. Class 1 licensees (HF,VHF & SHF) are using the prefixes HZ1 or 7Z1, HZ2, 7Z2 stations have licenses class 2 (VHF & SHF only).\n\nSaudi Arabia has constructed OSCAR satellites for amateur use. Saudi-OSCAR 41 (SO-41, Saudisat 1A) and Saudi-OSCAR 42 (SO-42, Saudisat 1B) were both launched on 2000-09-26 and are now non-operational. Saudi-OSCAR 50 (SO-50, Saudisat-1C) was launched 2002-12-20 and remains operational.\n\n\nThe club station 7O1AA operated for six months in 1990. On May 22, 1990 Yemen Arab Republic (4W) and People's Democratic Republic of Yemen (7O) were deleted from the DXCC list as the two countries united into one becoming Yemen (7O). There have been various claims that no amateur station licenses have been issued since. North Korea and Yemen remain the only two national jurisdictions which do not issue amateur radio licenses to their citizens.[14]\n\nAccoding to an editorial by Bernie McClenny, W3UR, in \"The Daily DX\", after the creation of the DXCC entity for unified Yemen, a team from Kuwait consisting of 9K2CS, 9K2DR and 9K2EC operated as 7O1AA in late May and early June 1990. Shorty after F2VX and F6EXV operated as 7O8AA during late July and early August 1990. And finally OH2YY was QRV as 7O/OH2YY in early May 2002. Each of these were accepted by ARRL for DXCC. There have been several operations from 7O that did not count for DXCC (7O1A - 1996, 7O1YGF - 2000).\"[15]\n\nThe ARRL DXCC desk does also recognize the Yemen operation by Pekka Ahlqvist, OH2YY, in May 2002 as it was conducted with written approval from the Yemeni government.[16] A recent operation from Socotra Island using callsign 7O6T took place in May 2012.

Adding insult to injury, the public blames oil giants for the country\u2019s energy problems, failing to appreciate that the prices and behaviors of these companies are often the result of government and market forces beyond their control.\n\nYet the companies don\u2019t stand up for themselves, says Mr. Hofmeister, who in his new book, \u201cWhy We Hate the Oil Companies,\u201d cites the fact that in Gallup\u2019s annual favorability rating poll of the 24 largest U.S. industries, the oil industry has ranked at the very bottom for the past seven years. It\u2019s also reflected in the simultaneous outcry against BP for its inability to plug an oil leak under about a mile of water and the virtual ignorance of the fact that it\u2019s because of government regulations that such pipelines are so far out to sea in the first place.\n\nMr. Hofmeister suggests that the oil industry is so unpopular because individual companies are intense rivals and have little interest in vouching for the entire industry. Yet perhaps the most important reason, one the author doesn\u2019t bring up, is that the oil companies are rightly scared of what the government would do to them if they weren\u2019t cooperative at congressional hearings.\n\nAlso, the economic explanations that companies could offer probably would not be well-received by a public with, in Mr. Hofmeister\u2019s words, \u201chearts and minds that have been taught to shut down\u201d when energy companies speak.\n\nYet we need fossil fuels. As Mr. Hofmeister points out, only 2 to 3 percent of energy needs are supplied by nontraditional sources such as wind, solar and biofuels despite substantial subsidies with taxpayer dollars.\n\n\u201cEvery form of energy has an impact on the environment. Clean energy is a relative, not an absolute, term,\u201d Mr. Hofmeister says wisely. He emphasizes that while we should consider the environment, we also have to be realistic about what it takes to provide energy to hundreds of millions of Americans.\n\nNot surprisingly, he supports tapping into the nation\u2019s vast fossil-fuel reserves, which should last us until other technologies become competitive. As fossil fuels do, indeed, become scarce, private companies will have increasingly greater economic incentives to invest in alternative energy sources.\n\nMr. Hofmeister singles out corn ethanol as being particularly unrealistic. Indeed, it\u2019s costly to make, doesn\u2019t contain as much usable energy as gasoline and is expensive to transport because it can\u2019t be transmitted via pipelines due to water condensation. In addition to being economically inefficient, it\u2019s far from clear that it\u2019s even environmentally friendly because, as the author points out, growing vast amounts of corn means greater erosion, clearing of land and use of more chemical fertilizers.\n\nThe author correctly says the federal government is incapable of bringing about the needed deregulation of the fossil-fuel sectors. Since 1973, when President Nixon promised energy independence, eight presidents and 18 Congresses have failed to deliver. This indicates to him a systemic problem, rather than shortcomings of individual administrations.\n\nPoliticians make bad decisions because they think they know more than they do, Mr. Hofmeister says. He writes, \u201cSome smart staffer in the House or Senate who may have never set foot on an oil rig or visited a drilling site came up with the idea that oil companies were sitting on thousands of leases that they could otherwise be producing, deliberately forcing the price of oil higher.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, worries about re-election impel politicians to try to look good by restricting oil drilling and supporting renewable energies even if such steps are poor long-term solutions. This leads to what Mr. Hofmeister considers a profound disconnect with oil companies, which operate on much longer time spans than election cycles.\n\n\u201cThe oil that will be in gas pumps and cars and planes and ships for the next 8 to 10 years has already been secured,\u201d he says. Private corporations, not the government, can solve our long-term energy problems, but it may make sense to impose parameters so they don\u2019t destroy the environment at the same time.\n\nWhat is Mr. Hofmeister\u2019s solution? He proposes the creation of a Federal Energy Resources Board to decide what technologies are most appropriate for energy and the environment. He suggests that it be modeled after the Federal Reserve and be independent from the government to exempt itself from partisan politics.\n\nHe writes, \u201cIn my mind, there is no difference between NASA deciding what technologies are used for space research and travel, relying on industry and science wherever it can be found, and the Federal Energy Resources Board deciding what technologies are most appropriate for energy and the environment, relying on all available sources.\u201d\n\nMr. Hofmeister isn\u2019t very specific about what powers this board should have, but earlier in the book, he suggests a cap-and-trade, market-based program, which he says he prefers to regulatory mandates \u201cbecause it is arguably more democratic and less bureaucratic.\u201d\n\nAlas, quantifying environmental costs is very difficult, and Mr. Hofmeister admits that no one knows how much a cap-and-trade program would really cost. Charging too much for emissions is just as bad as charging too little, and it\u2019s not obvious that any agency, independent or not, would have the right incentives to try to decide on the most appropriate tax rate.\n\nMr. Hofmeister\u2019s hopes for creating a wise and effective board that would be truly independent of government interests are far-fetched. Yet he does his country a favor by pointing the finger of blame at the government and not at oil companies, which, every time there\u2019s a major hurricane, are used as scapegoats so politicians don\u2019t have to take responsibility for the fundamental causes of the nation\u2019s daunting energy situation. We need more voices like Mr. Hofmeister\u2019s.\n\nRoger Lott is a writer in Pennsylvania.\n\n\nblog comments powered by Disqus\n\n\nClick to Read More\n\nClick to Hide"}

Brian Dedrick said a man reportedly\u00a0became\u00a0irate\u00a0and left a suspicious backpack inside of the building.\n\n    \"Due to all the recent events, and this backpack being left inside after he was disgruntled so\u00a0we're just being on the safe side,\" Sgt.

X-rayed the bag, had a few items in there that looked interesting on the x-ray but further evaluation found everything to be harmless, and pretty much just standard personal items,\" Captain Weaver said.\n\n    Captain Weaver said the man became upset about with one of the workers in the revenue division.\n\n    \"I believe it was more anti-government, anti-system, he wasn't happy with the services he was receiving,\" Captain Weaver said.\n\n    Jacob Marsh was standing just outside, mailing an envelope, and was told to move away from the building as emergency crews arrived.\n\n    \"I mean I'm not really worried about it, I mean it is kind of nerve-wracking because it's just been what, two weeks now, that something like that happened.

One month homeschooling under the private school exemption was proclaimed illegal in California, the next month it was in limbo, and then, in August, it was safe again. Even though God gave homeschoolers a tremendous victory in the Jonathan L. decision, many in California still did not feel safe, concerned that the legality of homeschooling could change in the blink of an eye. The attorneys and staff at Home School Legal Defense Association can tell you that Californians were not alone. We heard from homeschoolers all over the country who felt the same uneasiness.\n\nFive months have passed since the Jonathan L. decision on August 8, 2008. We have found that while many public school officials still oppose home education and try to intimidate families contemplating homeschooling into choosing public school instead, for the most part, the officials have resigned themselves to the fact that homeschooling is legal in California under the private school exemption.\n\nDuring the last five months, our members have experienced several attempts by public school officials to \u201cverify\u201d that the members\u2019 private schools (homeschools) are in compliance with the state\u2019s private school requirements by requesting information regarding curriculum, teacher qualifications, and attendance. However, HSLDA\u2019s legal department has communicated with those school officials on behalf of our members, citing the decision in the Jonathan L. case, which stated:\n\nWe note here that the school district verifies only if a private school affidavit has been filed; the district is granted no authority by this provision to confirm that the private school is in compliance with the other requirements of the private school exemption.\n\nUsually, reading this citation was enough to cause the officials to drop their demands for verification.\n\nWhile the public school establishment is never likely to give its full support to homeschooling or recognize homeschooling\u2019s success, there are things we can do to strengthen the validity and legality of homeschooling. We need to continue to pursue excellence in our homeschooling programs, to know and stand on our homeschooling rights, and, most of all, to seek and rely upon God\u2019s protection.\n\n\u2014 by J.

While there has been plenty of good news, we've had way more than our share of bad news.\n\nI can't think of any worse news or harder story to do than on last year's unexpected death of 13-year-old Krystal Bateson, which is outlined in this week's issue of the Signal. I've had to write a lot of tough stories over the decades, but I can't recall one tougher than that.\n\nIt still saddens me, even a year later, to think about it. I can't imagine what a rough year it's been for the Batesons. I certainly still feel for them, too. The thought of losing a child is too much for me.\n\nBut, it did happen, to a Baldwin City teen. It can happen here.\n\nAnd, I'm afraid, that's been the theme for Baldwin City this year. It can happen here. It has too many times.\n\nStarting with Krystal's untimely death while attending a softball tournament, the Signal has had to report too many stories that weren't good news this year. While her's was the toughest, none of the other ones were \"fun,\" either.\n\nFirst was the plot found on the Internet where a Baldwin youth detailed his plans to disrupt the annual Maple Leaf Festival using fire and pipe bombs. Luckily, that was discovered before the festival and nothing came from it.\n\nNext was the shotgun incident in the Baldwin High School parking lot where a weapon was allegedly pulled out of car by a student. Luckily, again, nothing came from it. However, I sure thought of that about the time the latest school tragedy happened on an Indian reservation in Minnesota where several people ended up dead.\n\nUnfortunately, there are more examples. Baker University had its share of bad news with various alleged fights, assaults, vandalism and car wrecks. There were other incidents at Baldwin High, including alcohol being consumed during the school day in the building.\n\nThe rest of the city wasn't immune, either. There was the news about five sexual offenders registered in Baldwin City. There have been too many reports of domestic violence and crime this year, too.\n\nYes, it can happen here.\n\nIn fact, in just the last two weeks we've had two other stories. Last week it was the city council's violation of the Open Meetings Law from a special meeting June 2 when the Signal wasn't notified. This week there's word about more than $200,000 missing from the Willow Springs Township, presumably taken over the last several years.\n\nI had never called the Attorney General's office until last week. I would have never believed I'd use \"FBI probe\" in a headline for a story about the Baldwin area. Never is a very long time. I learned that, once again, in back-to-back weeks.\n\nAnd, I'm afraid, there's more such \"bad\" news on the horizon. Let's just say the next few weeks could prove to be very interesting.\n\nNo, there's no doubt. It can happen here, whatever your definition of it is. We can only hope that not too much of it happens and that we all strive to do what we can so it doesn't.\n\nRegardless, we do have to acknowledge it and know that it's here. Heads in the sand do no one any good. We'll certainly be keeping our head up, no matter what comes our way in the next year.\n\nWe owe it to you, even if it isn't \"fun.\"\n\nCommenting has been disabled for this item."}

Granted, we may not have created many chances, yet on the whole we dominated possessions, closed down the Arsenal midfield and stifled their creativity.\n\n\nAs the half time whistle blew, I for one, could not believe the 1-0 scoreline. Arsenal had one moment where their pressure resulted in a Fabregas fluke goal that looped over the helpless Mignolet.\n\n\nPlaudits have to go to Bruce for the team mentality that he has installed at the club, as a few seasons ago the team would have been deflated following the Arsenal opener, heads would have been down and an equaliser would have been near impossible.\n\n\nA diligent second half display looked to have been for no avail before that man, Darren Bent, cropped up yet again with a last gasp equaliser that made one good point feel like an amazing three.\n\n\nFollowing the late winner against Manchester City in the last home fixture, Sunderland fans are being treat to exciting times, but I cannot help but wonder why we can never do things the easy way?\n\n\nIn terms of performances, none was better than that of Egyptian winger, Ahmed Elmohamady. He provided teasing crosses, caused Gael Clichy constant problems and won every single header in the air. Man of the match by a mile, this man has a bright future at Sunderland and hopefully this is just a glimpse of what he has to offer the team.\n\n\nI cannot fault any of the players at the weekend as everyone showed moments of first class football, including Steed Malbranque who upstaged many of Arsenal's superstars, Jordan Henderson who dictated some of the midfield play and Kieran Richardson, who is arguably the most improved Sunderland player at left back.\n\n\nArsene Wenger may have reason to be frustrated with the late, late goal, yet Sunderland were on the attack beyond the allocated four minutes and it is the referee's decision to play simply the minimum of four minutes.\n\n\nIf the referee had blown for full time, he would have had over 35,000 Sunderland fans to contend with, who were all willing the ball into the back of Manuel Almunia's net and thankfully Bent obliged with virtually the last kick of what was truly a magnificent game of football.\n\n\n#Ahmed Elmohamady\n#Premier League\nFlag article"}
{"dataman_score": 4.0, "text": "Take the 2-minute tour \u00d7\n\nI have an application where I have the 'core' code in one folder for which there is a virtual directory in the root, such that I can include any core files using /myApp/core/bla.asp. I then have two folders outside of this with a default.asp which currently use the querystring to define what page should be displayed. One page is for general users, the other will only be accessible to users who have permission to manage users / usergroups / permissions. The core code checks the querystring and then checks the permissions for that user. An example of this as it is now is default.asp?action=view&viewtype=list&objectid=server. I am not worried about SEO as this is an internal app and uses Windows Auth.\n\nMy question is, is it better the way it is now or would it be better to have something like the following:\n\n  \u2022 /server/view/list/\n  \u2022 /server/view/?id=123\n  \u2022 /server/create/\n  \u2022 /server/edit/?id=123\n  \u2022 /server/remove/?id=123\n\nIn the above folders I would have a home page which defines all the variables which are currently determined by the querystring - in /server/create/ for example, I would define the action as 'create', object name as 'server' and so on.\n\nIn terms of future development, I really have no idea which method would be best. I think the 2nd method would be best in terms of following what page does what but this is such a huge change to make at this stage that I would really like some opinions, preferably based on experience.\n\nPS Sorry if the tags are wrong - I am new to this forum and thought this was a bit too much of a discussion for StackOverflow as that is very much right / wrong answer based. I got the idea SE is more discussion based.\n\nshare|improve this question\nso you are looking for something like mode_rewrite for jsp? What kind of server are you using? here is a sample answer for tomcat on stack overflow. stackoverflow.com/questions/1563799/\u2026 \u2013\u00a0 Daniel Iankov Sep 9 '12 at 12:59\nNo, what I am trying to determine is whether the design is better with just one page for everything, which makes heavy use of the querystring, or using lots of folders which contain files which define the variables themselves. For example /server/create/default.asp would contain the line 'action = CREATE' (where CREATE is a constant defined in /myApp/core/constants.asp). Basically is it better to use ?object=server&action=create or to use /server/create/? \u2013\u00a0 ClarkeyBoy Sep 9 '12 at 13:03\nI am just trying it out now actually, just for a couple of objects, to see how much easier it is to add a new object type (category for the knowledge base, for example). \u2013\u00a0 ClarkeyBoy Sep 9 '12 at 13:04\nGot it sorted for server, so the user just has to go to /myApp/server/ for the list, and then the edit buttons link to /myApp/server/edit/ and so on. Easy to change and I think it should be easier to manage in this way as I don't have to worry about the user being able to change the querystring (meaning it is more secure). \u2013\u00a0 ClarkeyBoy Sep 9 '12 at 13:11\nadd comment\n\n1 Answer\n\nThe best way is to split it up. This will make it much easier to maintain because there are only small chunks that you need to deal with at any one time.\n\nWhat you need to do is to first create a framework which will be used universally across all the pages/functions. This will have common bits in it like access control, menus, validation scripts, styles, etc\n\nThen are there any objects that could be shared across pages? Things like business objects, data access layers, report generation, drop downs, etc. Put these into separate classes/files/etc. If you need to code it more than once, it should be in a library type file and included where required.\n\nNow build pages for each discrete action, and group them by functionality or by permissions into separate folders.\n\nRemember that a query string is an easy way for a user to enter in false data - does the application require a level of robustness? Best way is to use a session type object for passing information between pages for a security and integrity point of view.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nThanks for the input adam, much appreciated. I basically have it in this kinda layout: /ab/abCore/--all the core code files in here, then /ab/[business-object-name]/ for the list, /ab/[b-o-n]/edit/?id= for the edit page and then same for create / delete. Each business object has its own 'setup' file which sets all the variables which apply to all actions, then the individual homepages override them if they have to. All stylesheets are in one folder, scripts in another and images in another. It really is looking very neat now, and so easy to tell what should display what. \u2013\u00a0 ClarkeyBoy Sep 10 '12 at 19:18\nIn some cases I have nested business objects - for example /customer/contact/, /customer/address/, /customer/contact/address/ and so on. \u2013\u00a0 ClarkeyBoy Sep 10 '12 at 19:19\nadd comment\n\nYour Answer\n\n\n"}

Really awesome program!\n\nI think I have fixed the problems you were having...\n\nthis line was causing the image you had created so far to be overwritten with a blank image of the same size...\n\nI assume that you were trying to assign the image to the frame after you had created it... I couldn't find a direct way to paint a Graphics object or a BufferedImage object, so I simply saved the image first and then displayed it... The code I added isn't the best... there is no double buffering being done to keep the image from being erased in screen redraws, but this could be easily fixed by making a special class to display the image... I just used a regular canvas...\n\nAs far as the reason behind why your program would not exit... I think it is because you must specifically call System.exit if you are using any GUI elements... I think Java launches some kind of GUI manager that creates another thread that keeps all the GUI elements alive... so you have to specifically call System.exit...\n\nOn to the code...\n\n[This message has been edited by Nathan Pruett (edited May 31, 2001).]\n\nSaidul Islam\n\nJoined: Dec 05, 2000\nPosts: 18\nThanks Nate.

{"dataman_score": 4.0, "text": "Junction box ensures transducers meet EMC rules.\n\nHBM has introduced the VK20A junction box for 14 - 30 V DC supply voltages to increase the reliability of measurements by ensuring EMC-compliant connection of T20WN and T22 torque transducers to HBM amplifier systems.\n\nThe VK20A replaces the VK20 junction box because both the recently-launched T22 and the T20WN torque transducers utilize current inputs.\n\nThe T22 torque transducer is intended as a low-cost solution for applications that have less demanding accuracy requirements. Main applications include static and dynamic torque measurement on stationary or rotating parts in laboratory, test and measurement, as well as in production and process control and education.\n\nWith its compact and robust design, the transducer has a 0.5 accuracy as defined by HBM and comes in different nominal (rated) torque steps ranging from 5 N\u00b7m to 1000 N\u00b7m. The maximum permissible rotational speed ranges from 9,000 up to 16,000 rpm, depending on the measuring range.\n\nThe T20WN torque transducer, which has rated torques of 0.1 - 200 Nm, delivers an analog output signal 0 - 10 V of the torque with high bandwidth - and is therefore ideal for use in production as this output signal can be processed by all current analysis electronics.\n\nT20WN also operates without wear and is therefore maintenance-free: The supply voltage is transferred without contact to the rotor of the transducer. The return transfer of the torque value to the stator is as an analog voltage signal.\n\nThe simple installation into the production line is another plus point for the use of T20WN for checking rotary switches. The integration of the transducer into the test configuration occurs via simple bellows couplings, which are also available from HBM as accessories.\n\nThe integrated speed measuring system in T20WN delivers 360 pulses per revolution on two tracks offset by 90\u00b0. After the edge detection, this means that 1440 pulses are available.\n\nMore information is available at http://www.hbm.com/torque\n\nAbout HBM:\n\n\n\nFor further information please contact:\n\nTel: +44(0) 20 8515 6100\nFax: +44(0) 20 8515 6149\nWeb: www.hbm.com\n\nOctober 2008\n"}

In the meantime, Linux application and driver support continues to broaden out to cover most common tasks and activities.\n\n      In short, the quick-boot auxiliary Linux is among the free operating system\u2019s fastest and most direct routes to desktop respectability and market share.\n\n    \u2022 A Linux In Winter\n\n      It was about six weeks ago that, frustrated by the reams of viruses that my kids unwittingly downloaded onto my home computer, I finally downloaded and installed Ubuntu Linux, after years (literally a decade) of thinking about it.\n\n    \u2022 New Linux User\n\n      If you are also wondering about installing Ubuntu, I would advise you to go ahead and give it a try. I am trying to convince P that he should replace Vista on his 1GB laptop with Ubuntu but, while he is interested, he is still a little hestitant to take the plunge. Maybe one day!\n\n    \u2022 What\u2019s the deal with Ubuntu? Why bother?\n\n      You should really check it out some time. Really, you should. Plus you can even keep the OS you have installed now. It\u2019s called dual booting, now get out there and try something new today.\n\n  \u2022 Supercomputers (HPC)\n\n    \u2022 ClusterVision Spins Off Cluster Management Software Company\n\n      ClusterVision is a Linux cluster integrator that builds commodity HPC systems for the European market (more broadly, the entire EMEA region). The company uses hardware from a variety of manufacturers \u2014 white-box manufacturers, but also IBM and Dell \u2014 and packages the clusters with its home-grown Linux-based ClusterVisionOS and software stack. As of this week, though, ClusterVisionOS is replaced by Bright Cluster Manager, which makes ClusterVision just another reseller of the software.\n\n    \u2022 Supercomputers love Linux\n\n      Everybody knows Linux as an open-source operating system \u2013 available today for many different hardware architectures \u2013 which has become the de facto alternative to the Redmond\u2019s product, especially in the servers segment. Linux versus Windows, Windows versus Linux: this diatribe on which of the two is the best solution has been literally filling most of the computer forums and computer magazines. We are not going to add some fire on that already \u201chot\u201d discussion, but rather analyze some real facts and take the appropriate conclusions.\n\n\n      The operating system family share rank is as follows:\n      Operating system Family Count Share %\n      Linux 443 88.60 %\n      Windows 5 1.00 %\n      Unix 22 4.40 %\n      BSD based 1 0.20 %\n      Mixed 29 5.80 %\n      Totals 500 100.00 %\n\n  \u2022 Server\n\n    \u2022 Cloud computing with Linux and Apache Hadoop\n\n      This article briefly introduces cloud computing platforms like Amazon EC2, on which you can rent virtual Linux\u00ae servers, and then introduces an open source MapReduce framework named Apache Hadoop, which will be built onto the virtual Linux servers to establish the cloud computing framework. However, Hadoop is not restricted to be deployed on VMs hosted by any vendor; you can also deploy it on normal Linux OS on physical machines.\n\n    \u2022 The Open Source Infrastructure for Cloud Computing\n\n      The goal of Eucalyptus is to allow sites with existing clusters and server infrastructure to host an elastic computing service that is interface-compatible with Amazon\u2019s AWS, but can also support multiple interfaces such as Google\u2019s AppEngine and the Sun Cloud open API. Rich Wolski, Chief Technology Officer and Co-founder of Eucalyptus Systems, will discuss this and more in a breakout session to be given at SYS-CON\u2019s 1st Annual Government IT Conference & Expo (GovITExpo).\n\n  \u2022 Kernel Space\n\n    \u2022 10 Reasons You Need to Look at ZFS\n\n\n  \u2022 Applications\n\n    \u2022 New Themes for Chromium(Google Chrome) in Linux \u2013 A Screenshot Tour\n\n      I have been using Chromium in Ubuntu for the past two months or so and i am already loving it! Chromuim web browser, which even have flash support enabled, has changed by a huge margin, and definitely deserves your default browser status. New updates are coming almost everyday and we have already seen how to install Chromium in Ubuntu the right way. Now it is time to theme your Chromium in Ubuntu.\n\n    \u2022 Best 5 PDF Readers for Linux\n    \u2022 Download Lots of Files with Multiget\n\n      Avid downloader? You\u2019re probably scouring the entire internet for the things you need. Whether it\u2019s images, text files or music or something else, you could use MultiGet to manage your downloads. There\u2019s a graphical user interface for you unlike wget which is something you run on the command line.\n\n    \u2022 Beautify the Terminal\n    \u2022 Linux users: frag your online enemies without installing an application!\n\n      This afternoon after I got home from work, I fragged my online enemies! What makes this remarkable is that I use Ubuntu Linux, and as everyone know gaming doesn\u2019t work on Linux (tongue-in-cheek comment there). What is even more amazing is that I didn\u2019t install an application to do this.\n\n  \u2022 Desktop Environments\n\n    \u2022 New Preview Releases Of Mutter, GNOME Shell\n\n\n    \u2022 KDE\n\n      \u2022 KOffice 2.1 Beta 3 Released\n      \u2022 KGet gets some love :)\n\n        You will hardly remember of me, since I\u2019ve not being so active recently (my job takes me lots of time resources). Anyway, stay calm.. It\u2019s been proved that knowing who I am will not make you feel any better Smiling That said it\u2019s not about me that I want to talk but about a great coding team doing a great job with a very promising application. That application is.. imagine.. you already know since it was in the title.. It\u2019s KGet.\n\n      \u2022 K3b 2.0 Alpha 2: Review and Screenshots\n\n\n      \u2022 Bangarang \u2013 A KDE Media Player\n\n        This is my first post intended for the planet so I should introduce myself. My name is Andrew Lake (or Jamboarder if you prefer). I grew up in Jamaica and currently live in Seattle. I\u2019ve been a linux user since around the turn of the century but only started dabbling in KDE code about a couple years ago. Much of my limited contribution has been to the plasma project. As I learned more about the other Pillars of KDE I became more interested in doing up an app of my own. I\u2019m especially excited about the possibilities provided by Nepomuk.\n\n  \u2022 Distributions\n\n    \u2022 Gentoo Family\n\n      \u2022 Gentoo: Ten Years Emerge\n\n\n      \u2022 More explanations: why nano is Gentoo\u2019s \u201cdefault editor\u201d\n\n        Newbie problem: finally, there is another note: both Emacs and VI (and respective clones) aren\u2019t exactly the most user-friendly editors. A newbie user who has no clue how to work in Gentoo is unlikely to guess at first sight how to use either of them, while nano is pretty much the easiest thing you might find around. You can fight as much as you want about powerfulness (Emacs and VI are obviously much more powerful than nano) and you can fight about relative easiness of use (:w versus C-x C-w) but nano is going to win over both of them in that regard.\n\n    \u2022 Red Hat Family\n\n      \u2022 Microsoft and Red Hat consummate virtualization vows\n\n        The interoperability pact was inked in February of this year, leading the companies to \u201csynchronize testing\u201d in counterpart validation programs over the months. Starting today, businesses can mix and mingle Windows Server and Red Hat Enterprise Linux on visualized environments with joint support from Microsoft and Red Hat.\n\n      \u2022 Red Hat and Microsoft Expand Virtualization Interoperability Options\n\n\n      \u2022 Microsoft, Red Hat seal the deal on interoperability\n      \u2022 Red Hat hosts \u2018Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization: Make Virtualization a Breeze\u2019 briefing sessions across Australia\n\n        Red Hat, Inc. (NYSE: RHT), the world\u2019s leading provider of open source solutions, will host a series of briefing sessions across Australia based on \u2018Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization: Make Virtualization a Breeze\u2019.\n\n      \u2022 Open source virtualisation briefings come to NZ\n\n        Hosted by Red Hat, two briefing sessions will be held in New Zealand regarding the use of open source in enterprise virtualisation.\n\n      \u2022 Red Hat: An analyst day in improving times\n\n\n      \u2022 Three Things I Heard from Red Hat Yesterday\n\n\n      \u2022 Red Hat boot camp for FOSS teachers\n\n        The world\u2019s biggest free and open source software company will hold a boot camp in Singapore next month for those who teach courses in open source software at institutes of higher learning.\n\n      \u2022 FOSSCOMM Meeting this Sunday (11th October, 2009)\n\n        FOSSCOMM (FOSS Community of India) will hold its third meeting in Mumbai at the Homi Bhabha Center for Science Education, Mankhurd (Near BARC/Anushakti Nagar).\n\n      \u2022 Sun adds Oracle Linux to ops tools\n\n        Sun Microsystems\u2019 xVM server virtualization hypervisor has not yet seen the light of day as a commercial product, but the company is continuing to enhance the management tool. Now, the latest version of Ops Center has arrived featuring enhancements for running Solaris-based virtualization.\n\n    \u2022 Debian Family\n\n      \u2022 Where In the World Are the Most Debian Developers?\n\n\n      \u2022 Reinstalling Debian on the Self-Reliant Thin Client (updated)\n\n        However, after a morning and afternoon screwing around with this in between doing my regular work, I\u2019m ready to seal up the box and let Debian Lenny ride.\n\n      \u2022 Ubuntu Got it Right with Sudo\n\n\n      \u2022 Ubuntu Cola vs. Windows Cola\n\n        I just found out that there\u2019s a brand of soft drink with the same name as the popular Linux distribution. For those of you who don\u2019t know this yet, let me introduce you to Ubuntu Cola. Also named after the African philosophy, it is made in the United Kingdom and with a key ingredient that is Fair Trade Certified.\n\n\n      \u2022 Sex, Live, and Virtualization\n\n        Exhibit: Linux Mint. This is Ubuntu (and Kubuntu) done right. Mint is based on Ubuntu 9.04, the old Jaunty Jackalope. It uses the Ubuntu repositories so in essence, it is Ubuntu, with a little extra (contained in Mint\u2019s own repos). The reason Mint is so cool is that includes all those pesky codecs and plugins right out of the box, er, uhm, live DVD. No need to download and install a Java plugin. It\u2019s there. Flash? It\u2019s there too. That video? It works.\n\n      \u2022 Ubuntu 9.10 Preview: New Theme, Icons\n\n        A total overhaul of the Ubuntu look will have to wait for future releases. But for the time being, the touch-ups to Karmic should help placate users who worry that Ubuntu\u2019s default look is ugly and outdated.\n\n      \u2022 Karmic GDM Gets New Glowy Icons\n\n        Karmic\u2019s GDM received some small updates today that brought with them a new HumanLoginIcon set full of beautiful glowing icons \u2013 much more akin to the mock-up than the previous humanity icons used in it\u2019s place.\n\n      \u2022 Karmic Koala beta ships, praised for fast boots\n\n        The Ubuntu project has released the first beta of Ubuntu Linux 9.10 (Karmic Koala), which has already been favorably previewed, especially for its fast boot time. Based on Linux 2.6.31, Karmic Koala offers GNOME 2.28 and Ext4 as defaults, and adds \u201ccloud\u201d features and improved installation.\n\n      \u2022 Significant improvements in Ubuntu 9.10\n\n        I recently installed the beta version of the upcoming version of Ubuntu codenamed Karmic Kuala. The changes since 9.04 are somewhat subtle yet significant. Already in the beta you can feel the polish that went into it. Below, in no particular order, I shall rant about a few improvements that puts a smile on my face.\n\n      \u2022 A closer look at Kubuntu Karmic Koala and KDE 4.3.1\n\n        Ubuntu Karmic Koala is still in Beta status, but looks very promising. To some extend it beats the Release Candidate of Microsoft Windows 7, especially in Wireless networking support.\n\n        The big win of Karmic Koala are its even further improved speed, less resources hungriness and improved hardware support.\n\n        I tested Microsoft Windows 7 RC1 (build 7100), Kubuntu GNU/Linux Karmic Koala Alpha 5 and Ubuntu GNU/Linux Karmic Koala Beta 1 last week and I\u2019m afraid Windows 7 will (b)eat the dust.\n\n      \u2022 Personalities behind the Fest \u2013 Jono Bacon\n\n        AG: What goals did you have for this event? Did CLS meet, exceed or fall short of those goals?\n\n        JB: The goal was simple: bring those passionate about community together in an environment that is vendor neutral. I wanted to attract community managers, leaders and enthusiasts from all walks of life, inside and outside of technology. We really seemed to get this and there was an incredible diversity of attendance, and a lot of people: around 250. The entire event far exceeded my expectations.\n\n      \u2022 Staying With Ubuntu\n\n        The point is that Ubuntu works and there is little motivation to change to something else. Some will say that this makes me a \u201cfanboy\u201d. Not really. I have simply not found anything that justifies a change. If something better comes along, I\u2019ll change in a heartbeat. Meanwhile, I\u2019m staying with Ubuntu.\n\n      \u2022 Ubuntu Netbook Remix \u2013 Short review\n\n        If you have a netbook and do not care for a sub-optimal Windows installation and do not wish to wait for Moblin to come out of Beta, Ubuntu Netbook Remix seems like a good idea. I believe you will like the result. The combination of free price, lots of good programs, stability, usability, and decent looks are really hard to beat.\n\n  \u2022 Devices/Embedded\n\n    \u2022 Embedded development kits link up to Amazon cloud\n\n      SSV has launched two x86-compatible, Debian Linux-based embedded development kits equipped with access to Amazon\u2019s S3 cloud services. The first two SSV/ECC (SSV Embedded Cloud Computing) Starter Kits are the DNP/SK29-ECC, based on SSV\u2019s DIL/NetPC DNP/2486 module, and the eSOM/EK1-ECC, which incorporates SSV\u2019s eSOM/EK1-ECC module.\n\n    \u2022 Dev kit includes MIPS processor, choice of touchscreens\n\n      IC Nexus announced a Linux-compatible development kit that includes a RISC processor and a choice of touchscreen displays. The \u201cNXC2620 DVK\u201d version 4.0 comes with a SODIMM-sized CPU module, a compact baseboard, and a free BSP (board support package), the company says.\n\n    \u2022 Phones\n\n      \u2022 Hands On Nokia N900 smartphone demo\n\n\n      \u2022 Report: Dell to Offer Smartphone Through AT&T\n\n        The smartphone will run the Android flavor of Linux, and include a touchscreen and a camera, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing unnamed people familiar with Dell plans.\n\n      \u2022 Motorola describes close relationship with Google\n\n        On the day that Microsoft Corp. is launching phones that will run on its latest version of Windows Mobile, Motorola Inc. is singing the praises of open-source software, specifically Google Inc.\u2019s Android.\n\n    \u2022 Sub-notebooks\n\n      \u2022 Jolicloud to usher return of thin client\n\n        The availability of netbooks that ride on the maturity of cloud infrastructure is heralding the return of the thin client, says Jolicloud founder and CEO, Tariq Krim.\n\nFree Software/Open Source\n\n  \u2022 An inteview with Brian Kernighan, co-developer of AWK and AMPL\n\n\n  \u2022 Introduction to Freedomware\n  \u2022 Happenings: Open World Forum 2009\n\n\n  \u2022 Scan This List of Open Source Barcode Software\n\n    In honor of today\u2019s Google Doodle celebrating the 57th anniversary of the first barcode patent, I\u2019ve decided to take a look at barcode software.\n\n  \u2022 Get Wise About Math Concepts With Sage\n\n    With costs for academic mathematics software approaching $1,000 for a single license, it doesn\u2019t take a numbers whiz to realize that a free, open source option is probably a better alternative. Sage is an entire mathematics system licensed under the GPL and available as a free download for Windows (running VMWare), Mac OS X, and Linux.\n\n  \u2022 James Hall on Free and Open Source Software\n\n    Free software is a matter of of the users\u2019 freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change, improve the software. Like open source software, a free software license requires that the source code be made available \u2013 otherwise the user would not be able to study, change, improve the program. In this usage, the term \u201cfree\u201d refers to freedom, not price. This is also the origin of the meme \u201cFree as in speech, not as in beer.\u201d\n\n  \u2022 Firefox 3.6 public beta slated for 10/14, promises faster startups, loads\n\n\n  \u2022 Objectivity, Inc. Offers Free, Open Source Applications for the First Time\n\n    Objectivity, Inc. announced today the launch of the Objectivity Developer Network (ODN), a comprehensive website that includes free open source applications, code snippets, tutorials, and a community forum designed to accelerate the application development cycle for Objectivity/DB users.\n\n  \u2022 Open source based in co-dependence\n\n    Karen Copenhaver, a partner at Choate Hall & Stewart LLP, and one of Mass High Tech\u2019s 2008 All-Stars, is an expert on technology licensing, particularly in software licensing and open source. Recently she spoke with Rodney Brown about open source as a business model, where it came from and where it is headed.\n\n  \u2022 OpenERP: an introduction to Open Source ERP\n\n    This article is about OpenERP \u2013 a fully featured, free and open source ERP software suite. But before describing the features of OpenERP there are some background points to make about the use of ERPs by enteprises and the scope of the post needs to be clarified.\n\n  \u2022 Open Source UTMs\n\n    Open Source and free UTM solutions have most features which commercial UTM appliance have and at the same time are also far cheaper. Not only that, as these Open Source UTMs are installed on commodity machines we have the luxury to upgrade and scale the hardware whenever required. We selected three free and Open Source UTMs: Endian, Cobian, and Untangle.\n\n  \u2022 Ingres Database 9.3 Takes Aim at Competitors with Easy Migration Path\n\n    Ingres Corporation, the leading open source database management company and pioneer of the New Economics of IT, announced today the availability of Ingres Database 9.3, the latest version of the company\u2019s flagship open source database product.\n\n  \u2022 Medsphere Guarantees Meaningful Use for Hospitals That Implement OpenVista Electronic Health Record in 2009\n  \u2022 RIM needs more open source\n\n\n  \u2022 The New York Times\u2019s Open Source Project\n\n    Newspapers are either a dying breed or a changing breed, depending on who you talk to. The New York Times wants to adapt, not go extinct, and one of the little ways they\u2019re adapting involves a software tool they\u2019re releasing as an open-source application for their fellow news organizations \u2014 or anyone else, really.\n\n\n    That\u2019s all going to depend entirely on what kind of licensing the Times uses to release this thing. If they use a license model which allows people to keep changes to themselves (e.g., GPLv2), then guess what \u2014 people aren\u2019t going to hesitate to do so, and they\u2019re going to have no one to blame but themselves.\n\n  \u2022 BonitaSoft Reaffirms its Commitment to the Open Source Community and Joins the OW2 Consortium\n\n    BonitaSoft, first provider of open source BPM solutions, and OW2, the international consortium which promotes best technologies for open source middleware, announced today that BonitaSoft has joined the OW2 Consortium.\n\n  \u2022 Terracotta Adds Ehcache Cache Management\n\n    Terracotta has acquired the assets of the open source project, Ehcache, and has merged its code into the Terracotta caching system for clustered Java applications. No amount was disclosed in the deal, which occurred two months ago.\n\n  \u2022 New Features for Asterisk in Focus at AstriCon 2009\n\n    Another aspect of Asterisk that helps IT departments is the fact that it runs on Linux. IT administrators who are already familiar with scripting, network administration, and the architecture of Linux systems, will find using Asterisk to be a lot easier than having to learn a brand new interface that a proprietary PBX might use.\n\n  \u2022 Funambol Introduces First Open Source 4G Mobile Cloud Platform for Device Management and Synchronization\n\n    The platform enables management of mobile devices, and synchronization of diverse mobile media, over WiMax and LTE with social networks, email systems and PCs. The company\u2019s software leverages the prevailing Open Mobile Alliance (OMA) standards for device management (DM) and data synchronization (DS). Funambol is working with some of the largest companies in the industry to deploy innovative 4G mobile cloud sync services over the coming months.\n\n  \u2022 Misys Open Source Solutions Unveils Carbon Trading Solution for UK Organisations\n\n    Misys Open Source Solutions, a division of Misys plc (FTSE:MSY.L), today announced a new carbon management trading solution, the Misys Environmental Trading Platform (METP), to help organisations prepare for the UK\u2019s Carbon Reduction Commitment Energy Efficiency Scheme \u2013 a mandatory emissions reduction scheme expected to affect about 5,000 non-energy intensive private and public organisations that account for ten percent of the country\u2019s carbon emissions.\n\n  \u2022 The mod squad\n\n    I use Torque3D. Indie rather than Hobbyist price, but there are lots of cheap or Open Source engines.\n\n  \u2022 GNU Debugger learns to walk backwards\n\n    One of the innovations in the free GNU Debugger, GDB 7, is \u201cReverse Debugging\u201d. On platforms that support this function, the debugger can also look through the code in reverse from its current position \u2013 even incrementally. At present, this only works on platforms such as i386-linux and amd64-linux.\n\n  \u2022 Government\n\n    \u2022 German City M\u00fcnster Launches Pilot Project For its Schools To Adopt Open Source Software\n\n\n      During September 2009, the city reported that 140 of its 360 servers are running GNU/Linux. In a press statement published on 23 September 2009, Citeq stated that using open source is making it easier for the departments to share information.\n\n    \u2022 Shapps touts \u2018open-source\u2019 planning\n\n      Shadow housing minister Grant Shapps has laid out his vision for local authority plan-making in a speech at the Conservative party conference.\n\n    \u2022 Tory reforms to let communities shape planning\n\n      The shadow housing minister has unveiled a scheme to give local people more influence over planning.\n\n    \u2022 Shapps moots \u2018open source\u2019 planning vision\n\n      Shadow housing minister Grant Shapps has unveiled proposals for a more interactive \u2018open source\u2019 planning system.\n\n    \u2022 UK: Head of IT development Camden: \u2018Cooperate with open source communities\u2019\n\n      Government procuring open source IT should consider how to benefit from collaborating with open source communities, says Alasdair Mangham, head of Information Systems and Development of the London Borough of Camden in the UK. \u201cWe need to learn how to become experts at being members of communities rather than experts at governing them.\u201d\n\n    \u2022 96% of French Public Sector Using Open Source Says New Service\n\n      According to a French market survey, almost the entire public sector (96 %) is using open source. The most used applications are database management systems and content management systems.\n\n      The research firm who carried out the survey presented a summary of its report on the use of open source in France on 17 September in Paris. The report is based on an online survey conducted during the summer of 2009 and followed up by interviews with 160 IT project directors, heads of procurement and other IT decision makers, half of which are employed in the private sector and the other half representing the public sector. Another fifty interviews were held with IT vendors.\n\n    \u2022 Pelosi Adds Voice to Open Source Voting Systems Momentum\n\n      \u201cEverywhere I go, no matter what else people have to say, they ultimately ask one question: \u2018Why should we work our hearts out if the fix is already in?\u2019\u201d Pelosi said during a keynote speech at a fundraiser last week held to benefit Open Voting Consortium (OVC). \u201cWhen we look at the elections and look at how close everything is, you know that there\u2019s something happening in that machine that we need to know about.\u201d\n\n  \u2022 Openness\n\n    \u2022 Will open source biology get anywhere?\n\n      The big news is that this may be broadening. Sage is now trumpeting a \u201cmajor donation\u201d (amount unspecified) from Quintiles, a contract researcher with 21,000 employees.

The company\u2019s lawyers at Greenberg Traurig sent DMCA takedown notices concerning both posts. Despite Blogger\u2019s new DMCA policy, Google still quickly took down the post at Photoshop Disasters, causing the site to ask whether or not Ralph Lauren or its lawyers have ever heard of the Streisand Effect (yay). BoingBoing\u2019s host, however, doesn\u2019t automatically take content down and passed along the info to BoingBoing, who quickly pointed out that this was clearly fair use (commentary, criticism, etc.) and the DMCA takedown wasn\u2019t being used to stop infringing content, but to stifle speech.\n\n    \u2022 Fantastic Student Music Video to I Gotta Feeling!

The latest, sent in by Dennis Laumen, is that the Dutch collection society, Buma/Stemra, is claiming that it\u2019s going to start charging bloggers 130 euros for every 6 videos they embed. This is, of course, technologically clueless. The embedding of a video doesn\u2019t change the fact that it\u2019s actually playing from and hosted at the original site (such as YouTube). All embedding does is allow the video to appear via the other page, even though, technically, it\u2019s all still happening at its original location. Claiming that this is somehow a \u201cnew\u201d publication of the content is technologically incorrect.\n\n  \u2022 Dying Newspapers\n\n    \u2022 Economist introduces pay-wall for archive articles\n\n      The Times and Sunday Times yesterday revealed plans for a readers\u2019 club with a \u00a350 membership fee to non-subscribers, another example of newspapers attempting to develop new revenue streams from loyal readers rather than following a high-volume strategy.\n\n    \u2022 Monetizing Speed: AP May Charge for 30 Min Lead\n\n      After a summer of establishing blogger guidelines and fair use, the Associated Press is considering charging online customers for a 20-30 minute head start on breaking news stories. According to a report by the AP\u2019s Jeremiah Marquez, the AP\u2019s chief executive Tom Curley made the announcement at the Hong Kong Foreign Correspondents\u2019 Club. Curley suggested that because the AP licenses stories to major hubs like Google, Yahoo and Microsoft\u2019s MSN, these outlets would be willing to pay for scoops.\n\nDigital Tipping Point: Clip of the Day\n\nInternet Video Celebrity Caitlin Hill 13 (2007)\n\n\n  \u2022 Digg\n  \u2022 del.icio.us\n  \u2022 Reddit\n  \u2022 co.mments\n  \u2022 DZone\n  \u2022 email\n  \u2022 Google Bookmarks\n  \u2022 LinkedIn\n  \u2022 NewsVine\n  \u2022 Print\n  \u2022 Technorati\n  \u2022 TwitThis\n  \u2022 Facebook\n\n\nPages that cross-reference this one\n\nWhat Else is New\n\n  1.

It\u2019s great to be able to communicate with family all over the globe like this. I had just mentioned to people in the room that I was going to have to leave the Family Room to finish writing the Beacons when someone asked what the Beacons was about this month. I proceeded to tell her. I became aware of the faint laughter over my shoulder. By the time I came back 90 minutes later I had to tell her that the whole thing had changed. So many times I think I know where they are going only to find that they have different ideas. Such was the case with this message.\n\nIn the private sessions that I do with the Group we talk to a lot of people who have experienced the Phantom Death. Basically this is the original time that we scripted to leave. Now that we have the opportunity to stay, many of us choose to stay instead of dying. In all instances when I talk to someone who has experienced the Phantom Death, it\u2019s easy to see that their entire lives took a drastic turn at that very moment. Now the Group says that that same phenomenon is happening with our relationship to light. They say that from a cosmic perspective a big sign is hanging on the Earth that says\n\u201cCAUTION - Phantom Death in Progress.\u201d\n\nSpecial Request\nCopyright 2003. Steve Rother.

We see you from a perspective that we love to share with you, for that is the view from Home itself. Our greatest hope is to guide you in the new ways. You are not the same people who you were only a very short time ago. You are now stepping fully into the second wave of empowerment and that is changing everything that has gone before. The first wave of power was \u201cfollow the leader\u201d and the second is now \u201cfollow yourselves.\u201d Yes, this sounds simple, yet it is not. For you to function in the second wave of power it is necessary for you to totally re-evaluate every paradigm that you have created thus far.\n\nDawn of the New Light\n\nYou now emanate a new light. We have called you Lightworkers for you spread the base energy of love through the light that you share. Even as your advancements lead you to a new understanding of your purpose here on Earth, your advancements in the area of science will also begin validating even more of the higher truths that you have only been able to prove in your hearts thus far. The energy that we have called light will soon take on new meaning as your sciences are now right at the edge of great discoveries about light. This will start a shift in the scientific community that will have far-reaching effects on the way humans perceive themselves.\n\nFor those of you with scientific curiosity we will give you some hints here, and the rest of you can skip this paragraph. That which you have seen as light is only a small portion of the energy band which carries the full energy from Home through the central sun to you. The spectrums of light for which you have no perception exist over a band of other dimensional realities which you cannot see yet. The way to access these dimensional realities is through a series of 90-degree turns. Even the ancient Egyptians knew that to enter the afterlife, as they called it, a 90-degree turn was necessary. We have planted seeds of this ancient wisdom within earlier messages and now those seeds are taking root. What your science is on a path to discover is the relationship of light to magnetics. That relationship is exactly 90 degrees.\n\nRecently we showed the Keeper a new color band that he had not seen before. We tell you that he was very excited when we showed it to him until he realized that the words necessary to share this experience with others did not yet exist. Yes, there are many other spectrums of color beyond what you call the four primary colors. The point to remember here is that the other bands of color do not exist outside of those four vibrational bands but, rather, within them.\n\nIt will not be long before you begin to understand how simple light really is. And even though you may not see the other bands of light with your eyes just yet, you will be able to see the evidence and the reaction of this light. You may not know it, but we tell you that you can see this even this very day. That is the important message that we share with you now.\n\nWelcome to the 5th Dimension\n\nYou have stepped fully into the 5th dimension and are just now acclimating yourselves to this energy. Even as we say these words many of you find yourselves getting excited, looking forward to the possibilities of new power and new abilities. Yes, that is true, yet with this same advancement comes a new, sobering responsibility to use those abilities to their fullest. This is the importance of utilizing the second wave of power.\n\nPhantom Death of Light\n\nMany of you have experienced the Phantom Death where you had a specific opportunity to leave and return Home. These exit points in your linear time line were placed there in the first stage of life during your planning session. Those of you who have experienced at least one Phantom Death know that after that demarcation point your life took on a new focus and turned the equivalent of 90 degrees. Ahh, yes, now many of you are recognizing that you had a Phantom Death after all. We tell you today that it is the light itself on planet Earth that is experiencing the Phantom Death. When you look back at this time in your history you will see a new relationship to light from this day forward. This is truly the Phantom Death of Planet Earth and a new starting point.\n\nThe Crystal Energy\n\nThe Crystal energy has been filtering in from your Solar Sun and it is being stored in the tectonic plates of the Earth. The recent infusion of energy has caused much stress to those of you sensitive to it. In fact most of you who call yourselves Lightworkers are in fact sensitive to this energy as it enters your world. Many of you have felt lost and disconnected. You may have found your emotions erupting at the most inappropriate times. The sensitivity you have to this energy is the same gift that makes you a Master Healer, so fear it not. Yet, understand that you will acclimate to the energy as it enters your world. Continue to watch the solar flares for signs of this energy and this new light entering your world. It is here to provide you with the magnetic base in which empowered humans will thrive. The energy infusion was needed, for you are about to turn an important corner. The 90-degree turn will now begin this next month. August 2003 will be seen throughout the cosmos as the Phantom Death of the old light. Even as little as two months ago the times directly ahead were uncertain. It was not known whether the strong infusion of the Crystal Energy would serve the highest good, or tip the delicate balance as it has in the past. Know that you have done well and the stress you have dealt with has served a much higher purpose in acclimating this energy.\n\nAhh, but you are not the only ones feeling this energy. Those advanced children of Indigo color are feeling this energy most of all. They will feel disoriented, confused, anxious, and in discord as this new light enters your world. It may seem to them that their magic has disappeared and this may cause them even more stress as a result. Be patient with them during this time, dear ones. They are here doing a very difficult job and deserve your love, guidance and respect.\n\nThe Secret of the New Light\n\nThere are two ways to work with light in your Game. One is to reflect the light and the other is to be the light. You have so often thought that it was best to reflect the light, for it was very difficult for you in the first wave of power to see your true magnificence. Without seeing your true self it is not possible to be the light, only to reflect it. Although there is no difference in the outcome, and one way is not better than the other, by not having both options you are limiting the amount of Lightwork you can accomplish.\n\nWe tell you now that there is a direct correlation between the acceptance of your true power in the second wave and the ability to emanate the new light. Take responsibility for your own happiness and your own reality and have the courage to choose again if your circumstances do not support your spirit.\n\nNow for the secret, for humans love secrets\u2026 The light is not outside of you, it is you. You are the light. Even the light entering as the Crystal energy is actually a reflection of your own. That is the reason you feel it so strongly as it enters your reality. This new light in the form of the Crystal Energy is interacting with and changing the magnetics of Earth as it enters. This is why science may now see the connection between light and magnetics. At first you did not feel it until it was released from the tectonic plates into your dimension. Now you have acclimated the energy to such a degree that you feel it even as it enters from the Sun. That is the reason your times have been filled with amplified stress. The challenge is that you are not accustomed to being the light and allowing this energy to flow through you, igniting your higher light within. We ask you to find ways to let your light shine, for that holds the key to feeling comfortable as the changes to the Earth magnetics proceeds. Dare to stand in the most difficult situations and allow your own light to emanate from you. For that work we offer you a valuable tool.\n\nSpiritual Confidence\n\nYes, we have watched you and know that it is most difficult to be God in human form. Your egos that have served so well to ensure your survival have also kept you from taking your full power. Now, even as you are advancing past the need for an ego, it still haunts you, overshadowing your every move. Yet, when you understand that your true selves are spirit and not human, the ego holds you no longer. Therefore, we ask to you to find the spiritual confidence that is within all of you at every moment. Access that spirit within for even a moment and feel the confidence that lies dormant deep within your soul and you have a tool that can be utilized in the most stressful times. Stop, breathe, and feel the spirit within. Then simply feel the smile of spiritual confidence easing its way to your face. It is a subtle smile that can be carried with you throughout your day. Re-membering that it is there is the most difficult part. That is all that is needed to face every moment of every day with the confidence that is your soul birthright. That subtle smile gives birth to the full spectrum of light that is yours alone. That subtle smile is the most effective way for you to be the light in the days of change that lie ahead.\n\nTake that knowledge and intentionally share your special spectrum of light with every person willing to look your way. Stand fully in the truth and beauty of your light and own its power fully. Touch others with your light openly and freely when it is accepted. Then you will find it becoming stronger with each application. This is the full power of Home expressed through the most beautiful beings that have ever taken finite form. You are Lightworkers . . . but even more. . .you are the light. . .and we love your light more than you could ever know. We know your times are challenging, we know there are times when you cannot clearly see where you are going or what is happening. Please do not live your lives in anticipation of some magical day when everything will be right in the world. Please know that you have the ability to create that world in your own field this very day. Start by accessing the spiritual confidence that lies within you and you will see the new light upon Earth.\n\nWe so enjoy the time together with you in this fashion, for you invite us to play in your game in this special way. Ahh, but it is more than that, for you invite us into your very hearts and we honor that invitation more than you will ever know. That opening of your heart gives us the unique opportunity to plant the seeds of light that will help you re-member who you really are. Like proud parents watching with the greatest love as their child stirs from sleep and opens their eyes to make soul contact with the parents, we too are deeply honored to be here watching as you are now stirring, awakening from the dream. Know that you are never alone. We ask you to re-member that this is a wonderful game you are playing and to treat each other with respect, nurture one another, and play well together.\n\n\nthe Group\n\nIt is with great honor that I bring these messages of Love. My only hope is that you feel even a tiny portion of the love I feel when I write them.\n\nBig HUGS and gentle nudges\n\n\"the Keeper\"\n\nConnecting the Heart\n\nAwakening to New Light\n\nFrom Barbara\n\nSteve and the Group talk about the Phantom Death of the old light. They say this will be felt beginning in August. I know the energy of this shift will be high and we can anticipate it with excitement and maybe with a little hesitation because as with any change, it may be a little uncomfortable. Stepping out without our safety net and daring to fly high in our own energy can be scary, but yet quite exciting.\n\nI feel like I experienced leaving my old light almost four years ago. However, I am sure I am ready for another shift soon. This was when I chose to trust Spirit and leave my career that was my safety net of twelve years. I dared to trust myself that I was to join Steve in our Lightwork on a full-time basis. This was a huge leap of faith. I have never regretted that choice.\n\nLast night I joined co-workers from my past job for a reunion and celebration of one of their birthdays. Once in a while in the past few years I had been in touch with some of these people, but last night was an awakening moment of looking at my past\u2014who I was then\u2014and seeing my present\u2014who I am today. It was like stepping in and out of two different dimensions. How happy I am that I could return to be in my reality of my present life where I have created my new light!\n\nThe people I reconnected with are special, warm-hearted souls, especially one dear friend who will always be in my life as a friend and sister, Jean. They all helped me on my path of self-awareness, mostly in positive ways but at times in negative ways. Duality very much played a part in that experience. For twelve years this was my reality of daily existence that my world revolved around. For the most part, this was a rewarding job. How often we get caught up thinking our jobs are who we are! I see people who have lost the sparkle in their eyes. They appear to be existing in life instead of creating. I so encourage people to dance in their passion and play in their joy, as Steve and the Group says, every day of their lives.\n\nAs I sat enjoying the conversation, in which we were catching up with each others\u2019 lives, I felt myself falling back into who I thought I was for so many years. Then I took a deep breath and began celebrating who I am today. It was almost as if my spirit was lifting me above my body to look down on my past and present. With the exception of a few of these people, nobody understands exactly who I have become in my new life. They commented that I have a glow about me and about how happy I looked, but it was clear that my new reality was not theirs. And I know that is okay.\n\nI drove home filled with thoughts spinning in my head. I felt like I had just revisited my past. I know in order to create a new life, you have to come to terms with the one you have left behind. This is the Phantom Death of light that I can see that I just experienced. I was feeling mixed emotions about who I was all those years. The job served its purpose, but I have to say it had its moments when I allowed others to take my power and to feel less than who I know I am. One of the happiest moments was when I was leaving the old job and I told my boss how I really felt. I told her that I felt so connected to who I really was when I was doing my Lightwork with Steve, and felt so disempowered when I came into the office. This was the beginning of my communication that I have developed with myself and others. I must speak my truth. This is my empowerment. Even though it may have been something she did not want to hear, I think my boss understood. She wished me well, as did all my co-workers. I am now able to step back and feel any negative emotions from the past and know they were crystals on my path of awareness. I am thankful for all the wonderful, joyful memories I experienced during this time of my life too.\n\nIt is exciting to want to reinvent yourself by creating your new life, your new light, but it is important to never forget your past. Each day we have experienced is a stepping stone to who we are today. We can do a partial or total makeover with who we are, but remember to connect with your center being\u2014that is the Spiritual Confidence that the Group just spoke of. This is your core personality no matter how many levels of growth you go through. Access it and you will find your power.\n\nEvery day I discover different, new areas of who I am and who I am becoming. I thank my past, I embrace my present and I can\u2019t wait to see how brightly my new-found light will shine in the future!\n\nWith Love and Light,\n\n\nWe welcome your comments:\n\nLightworker is a non-profit corporation dedicated to spreading Light through Empowerment (858) 748 5837 www.Lightworker.com\n\n[an error occurred while processing this directive]\n\nCopyright Notice:\nPlease include this when using this material.\n\n\nClick on a flag to see translations available:\n\nIf you are interested in finding other Circles of Light gatherings click here.\n\nTo find out more about the Lightworker organization or being a part of the team please see http://www.lightworker.com/vision/\n\nThank You for helping us spread this Light.\n\nTo add, remove or change your listing please clikc here to go to the Light List\n\nbullet1.gif - 1405 Bytes Private Sessions\nwith Steve & the Group\nIndex of Meditations"}

Of course the bistro chairs used in their\u00a0original\u00a0state, along the streets of Paris, are quite fabulous but I also love seeing them indoors in these kitchens.\n\nOn a side note, this kitchen might be the prettiest kitchen I ever did see:\n\n2 BP blog bistro bar chair against black island and pendant lights\n\nHouse Beautiful turquoise chairs and banquette may cover\u00a0\u00a0Elle decor black and tan bar stools in white kitchen\n\nWhite kitchen with eat in dining space and bistro chairs\n\nmaison gatti bistro chairs farm 6 static flickr\n\nThe use of raw rattan, mixed with sharp colors, create such beautiful and interesting patterns on the backs and seats of the chairs.

I'm living in Europe.\n\nShortly before my sabbatical, my then partner and I decided to split up. We both still have contact every now and then and we respect each other, also because she has a daughter of 17 years and her daughter Sibille means a lot to me. She's not my biological daughter though, I met my former partner when her daugther was 4 years old.\n\nOn holidays like Christmas or easter, my expartner and her daugther usually invite me over for lunch and then we chat a little bit alltogether.\n\nNow with my new partner from Canada, I actually want to invite her to my country in Europe. So far, it was always me coming over to Canada.\n\nThe problem I'm facing is, that my new partner has a very strong aversion against my expartner and my rare contacts to her in general. To be clear, I don't visit them a lot. That's probably every two months or on holidays like easter and christmas. In rare cases, I do repair their computer, as they don't have a lot of computer knowledge.\n\nMeanwhile, my new partner from Canada hates my ex-partnerin as she expressed, even though she has never seen her and never talked to her. All because she knows that I still have some contact with my former partner. On one hand, I can understand my new partner, as she was never in my country yet and it's probably very difficult to trust from a long distance.\n\nMy new partner wants me to completely blank out my former partner. Meaning she wants me to completey stay away from the apartement where my former partner and her daughter live. She doesn't want me to go into their apartement anymore. Even phone calls are very difficult for my new partner to accept. If my former partner wants to ask me something regarding her daughter, that wouldn't be possible anymore. I guess it has to do that my new partner can't understand what we are talking about on the phone, if, if my former partner calls me. If I want to call my stepdaughter Sibille, my new partner suggested that I call her on her mobile phone instead of their home line. She is afraid that I would get her mother on the line and talk a little bit with her.\n\nMy point is, a daughter has always a mother. And as long Sibille lives with her mother, I can't completely blank out and abandon her mother. That's simply not possible and I don't even want to completely avoid my former partner.\n\nMy new partner tells me that it's not about the daugther, that it's about her mother.\n\nI know it wouldn't work trying to maintain contact with her daughter and avoid her mother completely. That's an illusion.\n\nFor my expartners daugther Sibille, it's important, even tough she's already 17 years old, to have a contact to another adult like me. She told me that once. As she has lost contact with her biological father. And she really suffered from that, not having contact with her biological father anymore. Therefore, it's even more important for me to take responsability and give Sibille the security she needs, and that involves as well dealing with her mother and my former expartner.\n\nI just want to know, If I'm really dead wrong with my views towards how I maintain contact with my former partner and the way I see it. I know, everybody sees it a little bit different.\n\nThank you\nReply With Quote\n\u00a0 #2 (permalink) \u00a0\nOld 05-11-2011, 9:04 PM\nJunior Member\nJoin Date: May 2011\nPosts: 1\nJoshk30 is on a distinguished road\n\nsounds like your current partner has security and jealousy issues that need to be may be able to work through them but if not you have to ask yourself which is more important your past relationship and her daughter or your current relationship.try talking with your current partner and explain your feelings about your expartners daughter see if she can understand your need to be a pillar for the 17 yr old and your parental instinct to help guide another young persons life.If not you may have to make a choice on what relationship is more important to you.It not fair but it is life we all have to make hard and upsetting choices sometimes.You could even try taking your former partner with you to meet the ex and her daughter and let her see how you react with them is nothing to feel threatened by.\nReply With Quote\n\nThread Tools\nDisplay Modes\n\nPosting Rules\nYou may not post new threads\nYou may not post replies\nYou may not post attachments\nYou may not edit your posts\n\nBB code is On\nSmilies are On\n[IMG] code is On\nHTML code is Off\nTrackbacks are On\nPingbacks are On\nRefbacks are Off\n"}

After grounding out in the third inning, he opened the fifth with a solo homer. The Georgia native added an RBI double in the eighth.\n\n\"Everything went well,\" Fletcher said. \"Right before I came here, I played a few games in Arizona [to] see some live pitching and get some rhythm back. It felt good, first at-bat, able to get that one out to right.\"\n\nFletcher went on the disabled list after breaking his hamate bone on April 8. Prior to the injury, he was batting .158 in five games, but had homered in two of the last three games he played in. With the amount of time missed, players sometimes come back with a rusty swing, but it wasn't the case for Fletcher.\n\n\"It's one of those things when you take time off you don't see live pitching for a while and it kind of throws your timing off,\" the 24-year-old outfielder said. \"Hitting in the cage, you're feeling good but going into the game is completely different.\n\n\"If anything I was trying to keep it simple tonight, just trying to see some pitches and just being ready. Hopefully, it will carry over in the next few games here.\"\n\nAfter enjoying a strong 2012 in which he batted .272 with 15 homers in 132 Minor League games and played in the Arizona Fall League's Rising Stars Game, missing two months of the season was a tough pill to swallow.\n\n\"I was trying to get back as soon as possible, but you got to get it full strength before you even start taking some live swings,\" said the son of former Major League infielder Scott Fletcher. \"It set me back about a month-and-a-half. I was in Arizona rehabbing, I could feel it getting better and better.\n\n\"It was missed time and it was frustrating, but at the same time, you have to take it and embrace it. I was able to come back out here and move forward.\"\n\nRey Navarro was 3-for-4 with two RBIs and Mitch Canham scored twice for the Naturals.\n\nKent Matthes hit a two-run homer for the Drillers.\n\nToday on"}

{"dataman_score": 4.0, "text": "Warwick man part of WWII family\n\nPhoto by Casey Dixon\n\nPhoto by Casey Dixon\n\nWARWICK -- Grady West of Warwick is the youngest of five brothers who served during World War II. West served in the U.S. Maritime Service during World War II while his brothers were serving in the Army.\n\nThe Maritime Service (USMS) was established in 1938 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt when a second world war seemed imminent. Roosevelt realized that numerous ships would be needed to carry war supplies to the fronts with specially trained personnel operating the ships.\n\nWest said the purpose of the USMS was to train men and officers to operate the merchant ships. In 1943, West said a recruiter came to his high school in Ashburn and spoke to the students about the need for men in the service.\n\n\"I agreed to join and went to boot camp immediately after I signed up,\" he said.\n\nThe 19-year-old West would soon learn, however, that the position he had signed up for was not what he thought it was.\n\n\"I signed up and wanted to be a fireman,\" he said. \"I originally thought a fireman was someone that ran around and put out fires on the ship.\"\n\nWest said he quickly learned that this was not the case.\n\n\"They put us on a bus to Atlanta and then we boarded a train to New York where the training base was,\" he said. West trained at Sheepshead Bay in New York, which at the time was the newest training facility for the USMS.\n\n\"When I got there, I figured out right away that wasn't going to be putting out fires,\" he said. West said a fireman operated an oil-burning system to generate steam in boilers on small and medium sized vessels.\n\nWest would not work as a fireman for long. He said that the need for men was desperate during the war and that many men were given jobs that needed to be filled.\n\n\"They sent me to Pennsylvania and I was assigned to the mess crew,\" he said. \"So, my first few months aboard the ship I was mostly washing dishes.\"\n\nWest said that eventually he was sent back to work in the engine department, where he found his calling as an engineer. \"They sent me to officer training school in Connecticut,\" he said.\n\nWest began working as an engineer aboard merchant ships delivering supplies to the Allied Forces around the globe during World War II.\n\nWest said one of his brothers who influenced him greatly was his brother Sidney Loran West, who fought in Saipan during the Pacific campaign in World War II.\n\nHe said his brother Loran joined the Army in 1941 as part of the Army Corps of Engineers.\n\n\"Their job was to build landing strips for the Allies in the Pacific,\" said West. \"They were taking the islands step by step.\"\n\nWest, said Loran was involved during the Battle of Saipan in June 1944, where he was wounded when shrapnel from a bomb lodged in his back.\n\nIn a letter from Loran to their mother on July 23, 1944, he described the attack as brutal and remarked at the headlines the battle had made.\n\n\"Say I better tell you where I am before you think this is a snow job,\" he wrote. \"Well I am in Saipan Island one of the Mariana Islands. And I know we have made headlines.\"\n\nLoran wrote about the fear he felt during the counter attacks by the Japanese.\n\n\"I can tell you that the first few nights I was never so scared in all my life,\" he wrote. \"Them bombs started to fall. I thought my time had come, I had rather have five Japs shooting at me then have one plane dropping bombs around.\"\n\nGrady West said despite Loran West's apparent injury, he continued to serve his country until he was discharged. Grady West said he brother would go on to get married, but died early in life due to medical complications of the shrapnel in his back.\n\nWest said another brother, Eddie Lee West, served in the Army Military Police stationed in the Panama Canal Zone.\n\n\"I got to see him on several occasions when I was passing through the Canal Zones,\" he said.\n\nGrady West said his older brother even took him along on duty one night.\n\n\"Their job was to keep the American military personnel who might have been drinking to much from getting into more trouble,\" he said. Eddie Lee also had to act as a detective for the Canal Zone, making sure that enemy ships or cargo was not being allowed to pass through.\n\nHe said Eddie Lee returned to the family farm after he was discharged from the military.\n\nWest second oldest brother, Alfred Clayton West, was the only brother to be drafted into the war.\n\n\"He (Clayton) was married and had on son and he had a paint business at that time,\" he said. \"He was drafted in the last group of 35-year-old men.\"\n\nWest said Clayton was the last brother to join the service during World War II and went on to become a successful contractor.\n\nHe said his brother Ray Gaston West, was the most deeply affected by the war.\n\nWest said his brother fought during the Battle of the Bulge, the major German offensive in Dec. 1944 and what has been called the bloodiest battle that the Allied forces experienced in World War II.\n\n\"They (the Germans) massacred a lot of the soldiers,\" he said. \"It was a terrible battle.\"\n\nWest said although Gaston survived the battle, he came home shell-shocked and experienced post traumatic stress disorder.\n\n\"He was having nightmares,\" he said. \"He would wake up at three in the morning screaming.\"\n\nWest said his brother was not very open about his mental anguish and that he regrets that there were no psychiatrists around in the '40s and '50s who could treat this type of illness.\n\n\"The didn't have the psychiatrists or medical personnel to treat these men,\" he said. \"They suffered alone. They were just victims of a situation beyond their control.\"\n\nWest said that Gaston never married and continued to battle depression throughout his life.\n\nThe men of the West family were not the only ones to aid in the fight during the war.\n\nWest's only sister, Lola Lou West, stayed with her brother Clayton while he was stationed in Florida and worked for the Army Air Forces Tactical Air Command during World War II.\n\nGrady West married high school sweetheart, the late Evelyn West, in 1946 and worked as an engineer for General Electric in Cleveland, Ohio, until he moved to Warwick and worked for 31 years as the production manager for the Crisp County Hydroelectric Dam."}

Children just want to connect and socialize with each other. Into this void, youth are increasingly turning to electronic communication, via text messaging and internet based communication (IM, Facebook, mySpace) to provide an opportunity to replace these lost opportunities. danah explores how youth use social networks in a way and helps decode what students are doing.\n\ndanah boyd \u2013 Social Media and Youth Culture (October 7, 2009) [right-click to download]\n\nNotes on the production of this podcast, the audio was captured on an 2nd Generation iPod Touch using Griffin\u2019s iTalk app ($1.99).

Posted in Architecture, Traditions and Folklore\n\nI came across a beautiful example of a tin tabernacle whilst exploring the area of Braydon recently, and I began wondering about the history of these most temporary of religious structures. Here\u2019s what I discovered!\n\nBritain saw a \u2018revival\u2019 of preaching in the 19th century through to the outbreak of WWI, with mass meetings attended by huge audiences. By the late 1850s churches were becoming overcrowded and the search was on for new buildings to use as places of worship. Non-conformists were not bound by the Anglican parish system and found it much easier to expand with new builds or altering existing buildings. Smith (2004) in his book Tin Tabernacles states that over 100,000 people were converted during this time, 80% of whom were non-conformist.\n\nWelcome, the tin tabernacle!\n\nWiltshire Commemorating WWI\n\non Tuesday, 19 August 2014. Posted in Military, Museums\n\nIn common with other parts of the country museums and heritage organisations across Wiltshire are busy commemorating and exploring the legacy of the First World War.\nI thought I would use this post to update you on some of what is currently going on at museums.\n\nYoung Gallery, Salisbury - Cicatrix\n\nA visual arts project of three parts: installation, drawing and film. The audience is presented with another perspective of the WWI Legacy with Salisbury Plain providing the cornerstone for the collaboration exploring the notion that memory provides the fourth dimension to any landscape, Cicatrix offers a challenging alternative viewpoint to mark the centenary of The Great War.\n\nBradford on Avon Museum\n\nExhibition focused on the themes The Eve of War, The Front, The Home Front, and Twin Towns.\n\nCalne Heritage Centre 1914-18 Memorial Project http://www.calneheritage.co.uk/exhibitions.php?extype=Current\n\nA five year long project dedicated to the lives of the ancestors of Calne residents, past and present, who lived through WWI. People are being asked to produce posters that detail how their ancestors were affected by the war, which will be displayed and then become part of the Heritage Centre archive.\n\nWiltshire at War: Community Stories\n\nAs mentioned previously (http://www.wshc.eu/blog/item/wiltshire-at-war-community-stories.html?category_id=19) this county wide project is now picking up pace. Emma our Project Officer is busy working with groups across the county to gather up stories of the home front in Wiltshire, Please visit http://wiltshireatwar.org.uk/ for more information or if you have a story to share.

Posted in Architecture\n\nOne of our latest jobs has been at the mill, Heytesbury, a gorgeous location with a clear mill-pond which the locals have traditionally used to cool down on a hot day. This mellow jumble of different brick and stone ranges, and varied roof-lines represents a site continually occupied from at least the early 17th century, and probably earlier. By the mid-C17 Heytesbury was owned by the a\u2019Court family from Ivychurch near Salisbury. They continued to own much property here until the 1920s. During research into the family, an interesting case of poisoning came up.\n\nOur Conservation team's expert handiwork is now on display at the Museum of East Asian Art\n\non Tuesday, 05 August 2014. Posted in Conservation\n\nThe Museum of East Asian Art in Bath currently has an exhibition showcasing some of their exquisite Chinese Metalwork and the conservation work carried out on the objects by conservators here at the Wiltshire and Swindon History Centre. The aim of the exhibition is to show that by carefully cleaning and looking after objects we can ensure they will be treasured for generations to come.\n\nThe objects on display are highly decorated often involving the use of, gold and silver or other coatings such as lacquer and enamelling. The presence of additional materials and decorative coatings makes the conservation of such objects more complex and so poses more of a challenge. Each of the treatments needs to be picked carefully to ensure the work carried out on one of the materials does not adversely affect any of the others.\n\nLacock Unlocked: On a Mission with Box 64\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWiltshire Women of WWI: The Heroine Project Presents DOROTHY LAWRENCE\n\non Friday, 25 July 2014.

As a result, this serious restriction affects the driver\u2019s side front two cylinders, flowing only 80% of what the passenger side flows causing an imbalance between the two banks and additional heat build-up.\n\nAftermarket exhaust manifolds that increase the internal bore size of their units compared to the port size on the cylinder head cools the exhaust inside the manifold only, but, the temperatures inside the combustion chamber is higher because of less turbo boost.\n\nThis has a negative effect on engine performance as it decreases turbo drive pressure energy and falsely lowers EGT readings. EGT is normally monitored by the driver to determine cylinder temperatures and by changing the base temperature referred to can result in engine damage.\n\nBD\u2019s Full Bore exhaust manifold restores exhaust flow balance, improves power and reduces EGT\u2019s inside the combustion chamber. All of which is accomplished by maintaining internal bore size thus maintaining turbo drive pressure. Get better performance and save hundreds of dollars by using BD product versus other aftermarket manifold kits.\n\nMade from high-silicon ductile iron, the Full Bore is a direct, bolt-in replacement for the factory manifold and is even drilled and tapped to accept the most popular EGT probes.\n\nProduct Warranty 36-Month Part\n  \u2022 Available Makes\n  \u2022 Chevy\n  \u2022 Available Engines\n  \u2022 2001 - 2010 6.6L\n  \u2022 Available Transmissions\n  \u2022 Automatic\n  \u2022 Manual\nProduct Rating\n  \u2022 (3.7 Ratings)\n    Write a Review\n    Installation: 3 points\n    Performance: 3 points\n    Read 7 Review(s)\n\n    \u2022 Installation\n      1 2 3 4 5 3\n    \u2022 Peformance\n      1 2 3 4 5 4.4\n  \u2022 Customer Reviews\n    Showing most recent reviews\n    brent - Dec 14, 2011\nCloseOnline Reviews:\n  \u2022 Dec 14, 2011\n    Installation: 2\n    Peformance: 5\n    Reviewed By: brent\n  \u2022 Oct 18, 2010\n    Installation: 5\n    Peformance: 5\n\n    I had BD install this product.

In the post-war World War II era, it meant establishing a campus in suburban Longmeadow - first offering associate's degrees and later bachelor\u2019s degrees. And in the late '90s and beyond, it has meant designing accelerated campus-based programs for adult women who, for whatever reason, didn\u2019t get around to going to college.\n\nNow, it means meeting women students \u2013 from Springfield to California - online.\n\nBay Path's latest venture is The American Women\u2019s College, which Bay Path officials say is the first accredited, all-online, 120-credit degree program, exclusively for women.\n\nThe mission of The American Women\u2019s College is as expansive as the panoramic view from its seventh floor headquarters at One Financial Plaza in downtown Springfield. Starting from zero students a year ago, Bay Path envisions a maximum enrollment between 4,500 and 5,000 four years from now.\n\nBay Path President Carol Leary, who works two days a week at the new downtown office, said the 120-degree program is \u201cnot an online course like any other.\u201d\n\nCaron Hobin, chief strategy officer for The American Women\u2019s College, said pains were taken to design a student learning experience that would avoid the \u201cisolation of online work.\u201d\n\nBay Path looked to students from its One-Day-A-Week program for inspiration in designing the new online college course. In focus groups with the adult women students - many of whom had never thought they\u2019d graduate from college \u2013 said that beyond the academics, what they liked best was the emotionally supportive environment, the sense of teamwork and collaboration and sisterhood.\n\nSo the aim of The American Women\u2019s College became designing instruction that was collaborative and engaging \u2013 a place where women could meet online and share experiences and ideas related to their studies.\n\nTo achieve that sense of belonging, Bay Path borrowed from the best practices from its own online program and those other colleges were using and then re-invented their own social-media driven model.\n\nAt last month's Women's Leadership Conference, at the MassMutual Center, Leary invited the 2,000 participants and the community-at-large to sign up for a massive open online course, or MOOC tied to this year's them \"Own Your Story.\"\n\nThe five-week course was designed to give participants a sampling of what online learning can be. Like The American Women's College courses, the MOOC was designed to be interactive. Leary said she likes to call it a \"massive open online conversation.\"\n\nLeary and Hobin credit David Demers, Bay Path\u2019s chief operating officer and IT expert, for helping the new college harness \u201ctechnology in a way that has never done before.\u201d\n\nDemers calls it \u201cbig data analytics.\u201d Using technology, the coach/educators teaching the courses at The American Women\u2019s College will be able to individualize the courses to meet the learning styles of the students. If for example, a student is having trouble with text-driven material, she could opt to obtain it another way \u2013 through videos or audiotapes.\n\nWomen seeking degrees is a big market. Leary said that the latest U.S. Census figures show there are 76 million women without a bachelor's degree.\n\nHobin said the new college will offer convenience and flexibility for women who want to obtain a bachelor\u2019s degree, but haven\u2019t had the time.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re dedicated to the education and enhancement of women,\u201d Leary said. \u201cThat means reaching women who can\u2019t get to a college campus because they\u2019re too busy balancing family, jobs, elder care and other responsibilities,\u201d she said.\n\nTwo weeks ago, The American Women\u2019s College launched a nationwide television, print and billboard marketing campaign in several smaller American cities including Bakersfield, Calif.; Albany, N.Y.; Scranton, Pa., and Pensacola, Fla. Many of the cities were chosen because of their proximity to military bases where women who have followed spouses to new assignments may have interrupted their college educations.\n\nDuring the academic year, the new online college will offer six, six-week sessions. \u201cEvery two months, students will have a chance to enroll,\u201d Hobin said with the goal being to finish in 3.5 years. The average cost is $400 a credit with financial aid and military discounts available, she said.\n\nCourses offered at the new online college will be based on issues women care about - family and work, financial security and physical and emotional wellness, among others, Hobin said.\n\nThe college\u2019s downtown hub is a 10,000-square-foot space overlooking downtown Springfield and the Connecticut River. The open floor plan was designed with women\u2019s needs in mind, Hobin said. It has a full kitchen, cozy seating areas, desks of various heights that take advantage of the view - and even a meditation space.\n\nBay Path leaders don't envision the online college replacing its more traditional campus-based courses. And it doesn't want to see The American Women's College get so big that it would undermine the personalized instruction it aims to offer.\n\nLeary and Hobin see Bay Path\u2019s return to downtown as coming full circle.\n\nOn the wall in the new college headquarters is a photograph of Bay Path leaders standing in Court Square \u2013 mimicking an 1887 photograph of officials from its forerunner Bay State Institute."}

And they are at least listening on righty Tim Lincecum and, particularly, right fielder Hunter Pence.\n\n\u201cWe are not in \u2018let\u2019s make a deal\u2019 mode just to make deals,\u201d Giants assistant GM Bobby Evans said. \u201cThat is not who we are and how we are constructed.\u201d\n\nLincecum and Pence are in their walk years. But the Giants are interested in retaining both, and their current intention is to offer them the roughly $13.8 million tender, which at worst would assure a draft pick between the first and second rounds if either signed elsewhere. And as Evans said, \u201cYou have to be realistic that if you trade a guy, you are not going to be able to re-sign him. That is what history shows.\u201d\n\nAs assistant general manager Bobby Evans hints, the Giants aren\u2019t in a fire sale mode as they have every intention of trying to win next season so letting go of players like Pence or Lincecum is unlikely. However, trading Lopez, who is a free agent at season end and 36-years-old seems like a smart baseball decision despite his close ties to the fan base.\n\nBoth the Cleveland Indians, as mentioned above, as well as the Detroit Tigers have shown interest in Lopez.\n\nTags: Javier Lopez MLB Trade Deadline MLB Trade Rumors San Francisco Giants"}

The new assignments too will be taken up post September 2012. Post the operation in February this year, Amitabh felt a bad pain which is why he went for having the CT scan.\n\nThe source adds that he is not doing any shooting presently and is scheduled to leave for the US in May or June. Over there he will undergo few tests and if required, he will be operated. But before leaving for the US, Amitabh will fulfill his commitment to Rohit Shetty\u2019s film Bol Bachchan which stars his son Abhishek Bachchan and Ajay Devgan in the leads. The movie is being produced by Ajay Devgan who is a family and also Bachchan\u2019s son Abhishek is there in the cast, Amitabh cannot leave the project.

They are then eligible for support financially and socially from the government. This is an example of relative poverty. Absolute poverty is the minimum resources essential to maintain living. On the other hand, the type of poverty experienced in Britain is relative poverty. Basically, absolute poverty is very rare in Britain.\n\nIn Britain, the \u201cpoor\u201d are mainly children, single parents, unemployed and people from certain ethnic backgrounds particularly Pakistani/Bangladeshi people. These social groups according to Joseph Rowntree Foundation (2000) are more likely to suffer from low income poverty, which is living in a house which is below 60 per cent of the median income after housing costs. There has been a steady widening of the health gap between rich and poor from the 1980\u2019s to 1990\u2019s. This has been reduced by more people achieving full employment, 2,500 deaths per year amongst those aged less than 65 would be prevented if full employment was to be achieved, also the government trying to eradicate child poverty could decrease the gap.\n\nHowever, after a white report on inequality in 2005 stating that people now live about eight years longer than their poorer contemporaries (Guardian 2005). It was shown that the health of all social groups was continuing to improve but there was seen to be a widening in health inequalities using infant mortality and life expectancy as a measure with the gap between better off and poor. The government need to make more improvements in public health in order to close the gap, they could do this by helping to increase awareness of healthy eating and also encourage or offer more employment opportunities for less skilled workers.\n\nInadequate income or lack of an income is the most common cause of poverty in Britain. The unemployed may be unemployed because they do not have the skills for jobs or the education and qualifications needed. This suggests that children from a higher social class or with parents from professional backgrounds will be expected to go onto further education compared with those of a lower class. In addition, issues concerning on how a person has been educated on financial issues and values from parents being passed onto their children is also another cause of poverty. Aside from this, health conditions are also a factor of poverty.\n\nLiked it\nUser Comments\n  1. tracy sardelli\n\n    On May 7, 2008 at 2:20 am\n\n    you have highlighted an excellent topic, great essay. thank you for sharing.\n\n  2.

Christopher McQuarrie might be one of the most sought after screenwriters in the world today, but no one really mentions his directorial effort, \"The Way Of The Gun.\" Likewise, David Fincher and Steven Soderbergh have Scott Z. Burns on speed dial, but no one really recalls \"Pu-239.\" Recent evidence suggests it's really not as easy as it seems. Academy Award winner Dustin Lance Black (\"Milk\") stumbled hard at TIFF last year with his tonally odd debut, \"What's Wrong With Virginia,\" (there's still no U.S. distribution for it even with stars like Jennifer Connelly and Ed Harris in the leads) and Bill Murray bud Mitch Glazer seemingly torpedoed his further directorial chances with the disastrous \"Passion Play\" at the same festival. Meanwhile, Oscar-winning \"The Departed\" writer William Monaghan's debut \"London Boulevard\" was recently met with complete derision during its U.K. premiere last fall.\n\nOthers like Stephan Gaghan and Charlie Kaufman have fared better, but there's a graveyard of screenwriter-turned debuts out there which leads us to (no pressure, dude) Chris Sparling. You could say that was quick. Last year, his Black List approved \"Buried\" became a small, but noisy critical hit (though not much of a commercial one) and now the scribe is making the leap to director.\n\nVariety reports that Sparling will direct \"Falling Slowly,\" which will star Mandy Moore and Rodrigo Santoro (\"300,\" \"Che\"), a supernatural thriller about a couple whose apartment is haunted by a dark presence. Wait, didn't Tobe Hooper just announce the same movie?\n\nThat's about all the details right now -- no word yet on when this will go in front of cameras, but we'd guess it'll come together shortly. Given the lower wattage star power, we'd wager the budget on this one will be on the lower end of the scale but if Sparling manages to um, write his way out of the box with this film, we'll tune in to see if he can make the leap.\n\nYou might also like:\nFree Indie Movies and Documentaries \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\n  \u2022 MandyMoorefan | March 6, 2011 8:20 AMReply\n\n    I like to do action/adventure movie or true story movie or she could play female killer.\n\n  \u2022 BradZuhl | March 1, 2011 7:27 AMReply\n\n    In their heart of hearts I'm sure every screenwriter imagines they're Billy Wilder or Preston Sturges.

As had my shopkeeping and useful work.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fred decided to return to town. He sold the country hotel and bought another in town near Kenilworth House. It was a beautiful place and I often wandered in the grounds. A little later Fred also bought a block of two flats. The upstairs flat was taken by an elderly couple and the downstairs was for my mother, sister and myself. I had been away from my mother for so long she didn\u2019t have any idea of controlling me. I came and went as I pleased and settled in to being my own master. My guardian angel must have been watching over me and kept me out of trouble.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My education on herbs and plants started when I was in Devon. A cousin or something was a witch and we used to collect the herbs for her. She seemed to cure animals as well as humans. The nearest doctor in those days was a long horse ride away and he only came once a week to a makeshift surgery in the local bar. This meant the witch was in great demand. These days she would be called a herbalist but then it looked like magic. People were afraid of her and I can remember having to pass her house on the opposite side of the road in case she was offended by me. Such a lot of nonsense really but the gift of \u201cSeeing\u201d was handed down. After an aunt, I should know. I was next. An aunt had the seeing eye and told so many things, even how many children I would have and it came true for me later on. That was what I was doing on the day of the common fire. Looking for herbs growing in the area.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This aunt told me I would marry under odd circumstances and would have four children. As I didn\u2019t care much for small children I only laughed. She was right. Not only that but on a certain weekend she begged me not to go away. I thought she was being old-fashioned and ignored her. So much for being a knowall later proved me wrong.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0About this time my mother decided we needed a holiday so she booked us into lodgings on the Isle of Wight. I don\u2019t know why it was only my mother and me. My sister must have been somewhere else. On our second day Mother booked a trip to the mainland to see the Naval Tattoo. We went over in a small boat, a little bumpy but okay. We enjoyed the show until the end when the wind started blowing. Oh well the other people in the boat were quite happy, there were three other couples, which made eight of us beside the crew, so aboard we went. As we made way out from land the weather became very bad. Waves were huge. One man there was an ex-sailor and said the waves were twenty feet high. I only knew they came crashing down and we had to start bailing. I was so scared. Suddenly this great big grey wall loomed up. I remember the ex-sailor swearing and grabbing the wheel. The boat turned so that water slopped over the side and I really thought we were going under. There were lights and a man with a megaphone was shouting. The grey wall looked like a house. It was a liner.\u201d The Mauretania\u201d.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The man in charge of our boat had not put up riding lights and the liner nearly ran us down. It turned back to rescue us but we were still afloat and our skipper said we didn\u2019t need help. The storm got worse but by bailing we kept afloat. Ryde pier hove out of the storm and we thought the Lord be praised, but a man came out of a door and refused to let us land. He insisted we would be smashed against the heavy timbers. I was so scared by then I only knew I was cold wet and near death. The morning came and wind and waves died down. As we tied up to the pier steps a man came and asked for pay for being on the pier. I had never heard some of the words used by the ex-sailor and we didn\u2019t pay, but another surprise awaited us. The police gathered us all up and after arresting the boat owner we all had to make a statement. Apparently he had already been fined twice for overloading the vessel and dangerous sailing. I heard he went to prison but he deserved it. I shudder when I think how near we came to death.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Another incident on the same holiday came when we were walking at Ventnor. Going past some tall iron gates my mother cried \u201cLook at that\u201d. It was a Fuchsia but as a tree. We only knew them as bushes but this was about nine feet tall. Intrigued we both stepped inside the gates to have a closer look. Suddenly a figure in a gown with a hood over his face stepped out. My mother screamed and ran. The figure caught my arm and with his finger to his lips picked a piece of the fuchsia and handed it to me. I was shaking but he patted my arm and bowed me out of the gates which he shut behind me. We asked about them at the local shop and learnt it was a sect of silent monks. They had taken a vow of silence and were seldom seen.

It was a long walk but all the different puddles had such interesting things to see. When a boat came close to the sea edge and a man called me to hurry out to them I thought they were mad until I looked behind me and saw a sea of water between me and the shore.

As a boarder the homework fitted in with free afternoons. No longer. Get on with it on your own. Nevertheless I still enjoyed school and had good relations with the teachers. I made the change from boarder to daily quite easily. Rules were still strict. One had to be polite at all times. One had to sit up straight with shoulders back or get a crack across the back with a ruler. I was used to this from boarding school and in later years I was so thankful for that training.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Despite this, I was still about to lose my stuffing....\n\nEmail this Story\n\nRead more of Darby's Stories \u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0 Read other great Stories\n\n\nRelated Files\n\nNo files attached to this story.\n\n\n\n\nAlready a member?

There are still - four months into the season - too many questions about Spurs' best system and personnel, and every competitive match can provide crucial clues.\n\nSo while Villas-Boas made seven changes to his team, it was no second string. He brought in players who should, in time, be regulars, in Soldado and Erik Lamela, as well as returning left-back Danny Rose, and was exceptionally well rewarded.\n\nSoldado was excellent throughout, scoring twice early in the first half before completing his hat-trick with a penalty, his fourth for the club. When he went off for Shaquile Coulthirst he received a standing ovation and Villas-Boas was delighted for his Spanish striker.\n\n\u201cI'm extremely happy for him,\u201d Villas-Boas said. \u201cHe's been waiting for a moment like this and it finally happened tonight with a hat-trick. It will be a major boost for a player who has been very professional and deserves respect.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a striker, you have to persist and persist; finishing off the situations you are given and that final touch hasn't been there for him recently. It will be a great boost of confidence for him.\u201d\n\nBoth of Soldado's first two goals, in a first-half in which Spurs tore into Anzhi, owed to sharp instinctive moment and swift reactions. The first came after just five minutes. To accommodate Lamela, Andros Townsend moved onto the left, and he won a free-kick there from Abdul Razak. Sigurdsson whipped it in, and even with the pace on the ball, Soldado flicked it with the top of his head off the inside of the far post and in.\n\nThe next goal - which will have pleased Villas-Boas even more - soon followed. Lamela drifted in from the right and played a delightful reverse pass to Soldado, who smacked it into the far bottom corner.\n\nTownsend almost added a third, his chip drifting just wide of the goal, although it was Anzhi who scored before the break, as Ewerthon bundled in a corner at the far post.\n\nSpurs, though, began the second-half in precisely the right way and were soon 3-1 up after some individual genius. Townsend chipped through to Holtby, running into the box. With the first touch of his left boot he cushioned the ball into the air, before turning his body and - with the ball still in the air - lifting it with the outside of that foot over the goalkeeper.\n\nRyan Fredericks replaced the returning Danny Rose, and Christian Eriksen came on - Spurs had five attacking midfielders for the last half hour - and they continued to push for goals. Soldado nearly headed in a Fredericks cross, before the pair combined even more successfully; the young right-back bursting forward and winning the penalty which Soldado converted, his fourth Spurs spot-kick.\n\nLamela nearly scored twice, first with a header, then a low shot, Holtby had a 30-yard shot palmed wide as Spurs finished the game with the same intensity with which they began it. \u201cWhat pleased me most,\u201d said Villas-Boas, \u201cwas the professionalism and dedication of the players; to give something back to a good house and the fans we had tonight.\u201d\n\nTottenham Hotspur (4-2-3-1): Friedel; Naughton, Capoue, Fryers, Rose (Fredericks, 45); Dembele (Eriksen, 64), Holtby; Lamela, Sigurdsson, Townsend; Soldado (Coulthirst, 78).\n\nAnzhi Makhachkala (4-2-3-1): Pomazan; Agalarov (Angbwa, 80), Ewerton, Epureanu, Grigalava; Jucieli, Razak (Gatagov, 85; Sobolev, Maksimov, Burmistrov; Serderov.\n\nReferee S Johannesson (Swe).\n\nArts & Entertainment\ntv Grace Dent on controversial BBC3 show Don\u2019t Call Me Racist\nsix nations\nHave you tried new the Independent Digital Edition iPad app?\nArts & Entertainment\nGame of Thrones star Sibel Kekilli who plays Shae\nArts & Entertainment\nArts & Entertainment\nScarlett Johansson stars as an alien in 'Under the Skin'\nArts & Entertainment\nf1Champion Vettel will start Australian Grand Prix from 12th\npeople Happy Mondays dancer to swap his maracas for political briefings\nnews US Navy veteran was 86\nArts & Entertainment\nart Chalkie Davies recalls his stunning rock photographs\nCaption competition\nCaption competition\nDaily Quiz\nIndependent Dating\n\nBy clicking 'Search' you\nare agreeing to our\nTerms of Use.\n\nTea Party Queen Michele Bachmann claims to be heir of Margaret Thatcher\n\nTea Party Queen claims to be heir of Thatcher\n\nMichele Bachmann recently accused the gay community of 'bullying' Americans\n\nThe CIA\u2019s nemesis: Dianne Feinstein\n\nRenowned campaigner against gun ownership and for gay rights\n\n\nUS Navy vessels have been discharging waste water\n\nTony Benn dies\n\n\n\nThe story of a woman forced into gender-selective abortions\n\n\n.... and how Syria\u2019s rebels\u00a0lost the plot\n\nClaude Lanzmann revisits Holocaust epic Shoah\n\n\nChalkie Davies' stunning rock photographs\n\n\nFood: How to plate up like a pro\n\n\nHow the wine bar finally got cool again\n\n\nMark Hix cooks with top-quality beans\n\n\nMonsieur Jacques: Behind the scenes of apartheid\n\n\nWill Titanfall boost Microsoft's flagging sales?\n\nShouldn't we all be a bit more charming?\n\nShouldn't we all be a bit more charming?\n\n\nYouTube stars target domestic violence\n"}

Justin Stroh is a lay Catholic with 20 years of service in the Church.\n\nOh Hey! I found my calling lol\n\nI stumbled upon yesterday and my boyfriend brought home a new pen for me last night lol. Is that a sign or something?\n\ncheck it out . I really really like the idea. When I was homeless (yes for about 10 minutes) I thought very quickly, as I was walking along , where could I go\u00a0because the shelter for women here in Calgary wouldn't let me back in , after I had gone to see my abusive husband again\u00a0. I thought maybe my brother could let me stay with him for awhile. It's a good thing I did , I was pregnant too , and I had a kidney stone attack . If anyone has had kidney stones , you know how painful they are. I was worried I was going to lose the baby , but I didn't . Everything was fine after 3 or 4 days . I have since then got them lazered and never had a recurring attack of kidney stones. It seems like milk makes it worse though.\n\nAnyhow, I didn't want to impose on my brother, even though he was more than willing to accomodate me, I just didn't feel comfortable being there . My brothers wife is a really nice lady but I, for some reason\u00a0feel really uncomfortable and inferior to her , so I looked for another place to live. The place I found was Youville. I really wanted to go there and they let me in , even though they knew I was pregnant , I guess they wanted to help .\n\nOn with the point\u00a0of the\u00a0story. When I was at Youville , a 3rd stage shelter for women, we were supposed to keep a Journal . Youville was run by the sisters of Charity .\n\nThere motto is : \"Welcoming women who are in need of our services regardless of race, colour or creed, St. Marguerite d'Youville was known as the mother of universal charity\"Sisters of Charity(Grey Nuns) of Alberta\nWe were told to submit our journals in every morning to our personal (nun, we each had one) , and she would read it and write some things back . Sorta like spiritual guidance . I guess they are trained for that sort of thing. I was pregnant so I knew my stay was going to be shortened but I had the most terrible time of my life\u00a0! It was a very stressful time for me . I practically got into a physical fight with this one lady oy vey! I did come away with some tools for life and that is keeping up with Journal writing . It is a very affective tool for recovery . However, I think if it used for\u00a0 therapy , it's best to have the spiritual guidance . Jesus is our Spiritual Director isn't He? Yes!\n\nI really like the idea of praying back the scriptures and to write about what Jesus is speaking to you through His Word , it's a wonderful thing to do I'd say.\n\nA series of Unfortunate Events\n\nI was born on October 4th 1964 in Sfax, Tunisia. I live in Calgary and am the youngest of 6. My parents got divorced when I was 14 still easily influenced. I hung out with the wrong crowd and started smoking, and doing drugs. Soon after my life shattered in a series of unfortunate events\n\nAbout Drugs:\n\n\"Satan wants you to forget who you are, many fall into this trap, leading them to neglect their soul; and they become easy prey for Satan who wants your soul.\"\n\nHell Exists\n\nI took the opportunity to go away to boarding school in 1979, and had a bad experience with drugs. It is there I lost my identity.\n\nI was in a stinky smelly bar and cried all night. I couldn't sleep and I began hearing voices.\u00a0With both the influence of drugs and prescription medication , I soon fell exhausted and unconscious. I ended up in a coma for a week. Only after I returned to Canada under psychiatric care they determined what I was suffering from .\n\nDrug Induced Psychosis\u00a0\n\nWhen I was in Mallorca Spain, my brother was travelling Europe. If it weren't for him taking care of me I don't know what would have happened. I remember subconsciously dreaming and my mind played havoc sometimes, and I almost burnt our apartment down with a lighter! \u00a0To keep me from burning the house down, my brother shoved his bed in front of the bedroom door at night, so I wouldn't get out . He said I took a shower once with my clothes on. It was obvious I needed zombie masters strict supervision .\n\nOnce I had subconsciously tried desperately to pull myself away from, who I thought was my sister, but I was playing tug-o-war with an arm and it hurt, so finally I gave up resisting lest they rip my arm off. She was an\u00a0evil zombie master nurse, probably the one who stole all my things, and for that reason my brother took me out of there. I am proud of my brother. My sister had come to visit me also and fed me some\u00a0brains yogurt, she said my tongue was swollen and hanging out of my mouth. I wasn't eating anything else. I also remember putting vaseline all over my face. That was wierd.\n\nAnyway, when my dad came back from working on the rigs we came back to Canada and got proper medical care. My parents were in the midst of a divorce but the night before I was to board the plane I woke up. I felt like a little kid but at least I was aware of my surroundings , because you can't board a plane if you aren't mentally able. I know my dad was praying for me hard . I'm not the same person I used to be. I could have lost much more than my identity .....but I lived with the consequences. I'd never foreseen being admitted to the psychiatric hospital in the long term but I was. If my parents would've stayed together maybe things would've been different. The way I see it, I was institutionalized or sentenced to life in prison with 50% chance of making it on my own..I was a ward of the courts and placed in a home for juvenile misfits. William Roper Hull Home. Alone and dangerous.\n\n\nMy faith in God dwindled from the Catholic Church and I married a\u00a0sexual deviant . I had 7 children whom Child Services apprehended from a terrible ordeal. In my sorrow over such great loss I found my comfort in this Scripture verse:\nJeremiah 49:11\"Leave your fatherless children, I will preserve them alive. Let your widows trust in Me\" So I did. I pray for them everyday . From what I know they are growing up to be fine children and I guess I have certain someone's of which I won't mention names, to thank for. Although I still like to think I had something to do with it. That their good kids, that is, I hope.\n\nfrom left to right : Curtis, Alex, Joshua.\n....hear no evil, see no evil and speak no evil\nAnyhow, I lost my family, my identity and my children.\n\nYes I am broken. I don't see much of anyone anymore.\n\nNovember 23, 2009\n\nSwitchfoot- We were meant to live\n\nI like their music.\n\nThe solemnity of Christ the King\n\nMass Readings\n\nMy Reflection\n\nI think most of us have forgotten where we come from. I naturally am not born into royalty , but that is what we are, spiritually . We belong to the Most High and therefore we descend from sovereignty and splendour as Vassula so aptly put it . (<--this is a windows media audio play. )\n\"...I, your God tell you: sons! and daughters! you are the offspring of the Most High! you descend from the Sovereignty and Splendour, oh come! you belong to Us! you belong to are of Royal Descent...\"\n\u00a0We all have wandered so far away from God , that we have forgotten who we are and to whom we belong.\u00a0Jesus didn't say he wasn't a king when pilate confronted him. In fact, He says \"\u00a0For this I was born and for this I came into the world, to testify to the truth. Everyone who belongs to the truth listens to my voice.\"\u00a0\u00a0For Isaiah\u00a09:5 says that we will call him that ...\nOk , it doesn't say He is King necessarily but that His Throne will have dominion forever\u00a0. We are descendents of the Most High. Praised Be The LORD.\n\nNovember 22, 2009\n\nSo I got my new computer\n\nI now have Windows Vista. I love it.

Caught Injecting Live Bird Flu Virus Into Flu Vaccines\n\nFurther, He told us to stay out of crowds, and to wash our hands often.\n\nThe Plagues Will Now Begin\n\nOnce again, we hasten to emphasize that we have nothing to worry about, provided that we obey Our Lord's directives in the writings above, and those which follow.\n\nWhat follows are:- certain relevant messages from Our Lord via John Leary (3)\n\nApril 27, 2009:\nJesus said: \"My people, I have been preparing you for a coming pandemic virus that will kill many people. I have encouraged you to buy some masks and to take Hawthorn herbs by pill or tea to build up your immune system. Some times you have seen various scare hypes with SARS, West Nile, and Bird Flu, but there were never large numbers killed. Influenza does kill many people each year, but you have not seen a very virulent flu up to now in recent years. The latest attention is being drawn to the Swine Flu which is still being investigated in Mexico and the U.S. Some scare tactics have been used in the past, but beware of a coming disease that will have a high mortality rate. The one world people use such diseases to lower the population as part of their death culture plan. Many of these viruses are man-made for this purpose of reducing the population, and scaring the people with such threats. Many upper respiratory symptoms are a result of the viruses placed in the chemtrails that you see in the skies. Be watchful when a deadly disease starts killing off the people because this will be one of your signs to call on Me to have your guardian angels lead you to the nearest refuge. Looking on the luminous crosses and drinking from the miraculous spring water will heal you of this disease, much like Moses held up the bronze serpent to heal the Israelites' snake bites.\"\n\nJesus said: \"My people, this latest scare of swine flu spreading to five countries and various states has shown human to human contact and it is very communicable as the regular flu bugs are. An unusual aspect of this outbreak is that it is occurring at the end of the flu season in a warm country. It has been deadly in killing people in Mexico, but it has not been seen to cause any deaths in the U.S. Such an outbreak has already closed schools to stop it from spreading, and people are wearing masks to try and prevent it also. This incident could be exploited by the one world people to control the people through quarantines, even without deaths from this disease. A more virulent form could mutate and cause more deaths, especially if it were a man-made virus spread to reduce the population on purpose. I will warn My faithful when a deadly strain will be used against you. At My refuges you will be healed of these pandemic diseases. So have no fear when I am at your side. \"\n\nMay 1, 2009:\nJesus said: \"My people, I have given you many messages concerning chemtrails where your government is purposely putting viruses in them to lower your people's immune systems and cause upper respiratory infections. This is all part of the death culture people who are trying to reduce the population so the one world people have less people to control. Many of these scare diseases are man-made and this latest swine flu is another excuse for involuntary quarantines for wherever the one world people want to control. This name of swine flu has even confused people that they did not want to eat pork, so now the media is using H1N1 as a new name. I have told you in the past (2-8-08, 2-18-08, 4-25-08) to avoid taking flu shots because they will be giving you live viruses that could spread disease instead of preventing it. There have been reports in your literature that one drug company has in fact put live Avian flu virus in a bird flu vaccine (4). I am warning you again that this new vaccine for swine flu will be made by similar companies which could spread the disease more than prevent it. The death culture people are more intent on reducing the population than preventing any epidemic. I know these are difficult warnings, but there are evidences to defy nature and cause more deaths in the population. AIDS and ebola are other examples of this same man-made manipulation by the one world people. As these diseases mutate, it will become necessary for My faithful to go to My refuges where you will be healed of these diseases by looking on My luminous cross and drinking the healing spring water. Having masks, taking Hawthorn herbs, and vitamins will also build up your immune system to fight these viruses.\"\n\nJesus said: \"My people, as more facts about swine flu come out in your news, you are seeing that this strain is not as deadly as your media was describing. It appears swine flu is more communicable, but less deadly because humans can develop antibodies to fight it off. Bird flu is more deadly, but it is less communicable. Only a small number of deaths have actually been confirmed from swine flu by your scientists. There could be a lot of swine flu passed in the population, but it would take some major mutations to become very deadly. Be prepared for this possibility with masks and building up your immune system with Hawthorn, herbs, and vitamins.\"\n\nMay 14, 2009:\nJesus said: \"My people, your scientists are concerned that this current Swine Flu is spreading freely all across the world. This is an H1N1 flu which has a similar structure to the H1N1 Spanish Flu that was very deadly in its mortality rate in 1918. Even if this pandemic has not killed many people, there is a fear that it could mutate to a more deadly flu in the next flu season. This is another example of why it is hard to anticipate which flu that will be prevalent in the next season. Pray that people will have enough antibodies to fight off whatever flu emerges next fall.\"\n\nMay 22, 2009:\nJesus said: \"My people, you are currently seeing the Swine Flu spread over many countries, and some people are dying from this first wave of this flu germ. There are plans to spread a second and third wave of a more virulent Swine Flu virus by the use of chemtrails. The evil ones will protect themselves with an antidote vaccine. As more people start dying from this flu, you will see that it has a man-made origin by looking at the DNA markers of the segments in each wave. Already the current Swine Flu has pig flu segments, bird flu segments, human flu segments and flu from various countries all over the world. The fact, that it is still killing people and not dying out, is another sign that it is a manufactured virus and not a natural one. The one world people will use this so-called pandemic virus to make it mandatory to take their vaccine which will actually spread the disease. My people should refuse this vaccine at all costs. Those, who refuse to take the vaccine shots will be taken to the death camps for elimination by gas and cremation. Once this mandatory vaccine for Swine Flu is initiated, this will be another sign to call on Me and I will have your guardian angels lead you to a refuge where you will look upon My luminous cross and drink the spring water to protect you from any pandemic virus. This created crisis of a pandemic virus will be another opportunity for the one world people to declare martial law and take over America. Follow My instructions and you will be protected from this virus and from those trying to kill you.\"\n\nJune 18, 2009:\nI could see some men digging a hole and this was to indicate that the recent Swine flu was man-made. Jesus said: \u201cMy people, you know that the flu season starts in October and is usually over in February. This latest outbreak of Swine flu has been designated a pandemic, but it is completely out of season. This flu is not just a mutation, but it has all the signs of a laboratory man-made disease. This first wave has been spread very easily, but it has thus far not killed very many people. This H1N1 virus has similarities to the Spanish flu that killed millions of people. The same evil ones, who developed this disease, could just as easily generate a more virulent form that could attack your population in October with more deaths occurring. This is why you need masks and food storage to weather this coming outbreak. Build up your immune system with Hawthorn, herbs, and vitamins. As you see larger numbers dying from this new virus, then you are to call on Me to lead you to My refuges. There you will look upon My luminous cross and drink the healing spring waters which will protect you from all diseases and deadly viruses, or bacteria.\u201d\n\nJuly 20, 2009:\nI could see a young child playing and I realized that these little ones will be vulnerable to the latest flu bugs. Jesus said: \"My people, I have warned you before not to take any flu shots because they are putting viruses in these shots that could make you more vulnerable to the latest swine flu. This latest epidemic will be man-made and they will propose a vaccine that is supposed to protect you from this flu strain. Unfortunately, this will be a cruel hoax that will actually make you more vulnerable to the current swine flu. Continue to avoid these flu shots, even if they try to force them on the population. There will be various quarantines that could be used by the one world people to try and gain control for their North American Union. Pray for My protection and any needed healing from these man-made diseases.\"\n  \u2022 (3)-\u00a0 The mystical occurrences of John Leary have yet-to-be-approved by the Church.

Learn To Pray The Rosary\n\n\"The word 'Rosary' means 'Crown of Roses,' that is to say that every time someone says the Rosary devoutly, they place a crown of one hundred fifty-three red roses and sixteen white roses upon the heads of Jesus and Mary.

There are 26 main statements Our Lady has told us about fasting. The facts about fasting are as follows:\n\n1. Fasting stops wars.\n2. Fasting can suspend the laws of nature.\n3. Fasting reduces punishments from God.\n4. Fasting is an \"arm,\" a weapon of significant power to defeat (of which atomic power does not compare).\n5. Bread and water is the best fast.\n6. Fasting, to be powerful, must be done with the heart.\n7. Through fasting, the whole plan of Our Lady, that God himself planned for the world's salvation during this special time, will be achieved.\n8. By giving our fasting to Our Lady, it \"forces\" Satan not to be able to seduce us to evil and drives him away.\n9. Fasting purifies our hearts from the sins of our past (Through Confession, sins of the past are forgiven, but healing from life-long vice or memories that Satan uses against us to lead us back into sin, requires purification).\n10. Fasting, coupled with prayer WILL obtain EVERYTHING you ask for (the exception would be something illicit).\n11. Fasting sanctifies you to receive the Holy Spirit.\n12. Humility is a fruit from fasting, when coupled with prayer.\n13. The present fasting in the Church is not adequate. Our Lady desires this to change. She said fasting has been forgotten in the last quarter of this century in the Catholic Church.\n14. Fasting is one element that keeps Satan from conquering us. Faith and prayer are the other two. We, in turn, are to conquer Satan. The arms to do so are fasting coupled with prayer.\n15. Satan is enraged against those who fast and convert.\n16. Fasting for the sick can cure them along with faith and prayer.\n17. Fasting, along with prayer, was offered as a remedy by Our Lady to stop arguments among the Holy Priesthood.\n18. Fasting will bring the Kingdom of God among us.\n19. Fasting makes Our Lady happy.\n20. Fasting will make prayer more vigorous.\n21. Our Lady will make the maximum good come from our fast. She wants us to give our fast to Her in which she \"disposes of them\" according to the will of God.\n22. Fasting, coupled with prayer, especially community prayer, will protect you from Satan's aggression in destroying marriages, creating division among priests and will crush him in his plans for obsessions and murders in society today of which Our Lady says he is responsible.\n23. To obtain a grace from God, it is best you let no one know you are fasting.\n24. We are to fast out of gratitude.\n25. Fasting is to be encouraged in others.\n26. Our Lady tells us to fast to prepare for the coming of Jesus.\n\n**all facts are from the Fasting booklet published by Caritas, Birmingham, AL\n\nI know October has come and gone but it's never too late. You can make November a journey of prayer and fasting also . Every time you pray the rosary , Our lady says to offer your worries to her, and in return PRAY FOR HER INTENTIONS. She will take care of your worries as long as you offer your prayers for her intentions. Simple right? It seems much easier to me . When I pray the rosary all's I have to do is offer my worries to her and pray for her intentions . That is much better then going through a laundry list of my own lol.\n\nNovember 4, 2009\n\nHow NOT to put automatic music players on blogs\n\nExcuse me , it's not that I dislike YOUR music , it's that I prefer to have the option in listening to it AFTER I visit your site.

{"dataman_score": 4.0, "text": "In this issue:\n\n\nOur guest writer for this issue is Alkhatim Adlan, who is a political activist and thinker, who studied philosophy at the University of Khartoum. He spent 8 years in prison during Numairi's 16 years rule. Alkhatim emerged after the Intifada in 1984 as one the prominent spokesmen of the Sudanese Communist Party (SCP). He practiced journalism in Almidan and became editor-in-chief of the youth paper, Alshabiba. He went underground immediately after the NIF takeover on June 1989, and worked clandestinely against the regime for more than four years. At the time, he was described as the 'most wanted' politician by Sudanese security forces. He left Sudan incognito in October 1993. He resigned from the SCP in October 1994, denouncing the party for its bankruptcy and the obsolescence of Marxism. He formed, with others, the New Forces Democratic Movement (NFDM), of which he is now president. He authored numerous political and analysis articles.\nPlease note that articles by guest writers express the writer's views which do not necessarily coincide with the editor's.\n\nBy Alkhatim Adlan\n\nDuring the last three months, the Sudanese political scene has been dominated by two events:\n  1. The sudden arrival of Sadig Almahdi in Asmara, Eritrea in December 96.\n  2. The escalation of military confrontation between the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) and government forces along the eastern borders with Eritrea and Ethiopia in January this year.\nBoth events may prove to be of lasting significance for the future of Sudan, and that was why they gained very wide coverage in Sudanese and Arabic media.\nSome points may still be relevant:\n\nA warm welcome and some questions for Sadig\nHaving been subjected to continual harassment by the regime for more than seven years; detained five times; held hostage and seriously threatened; the arrival of Sadig was met with universal jubilation from Sudanese across the whole political spectrum. His unwavering defiance of the government; his outspoken and earnest call for the restoration of democracy; his readiness for military confrontation to guard his uncharted route out of Sudan; helped him regain some of the support he had lost through the despicable failure of his previous five governments.\nDespite the euphoria inspired by his arrival, however, some important questions lingered in the air, and still do. Some of them are the following:\n\nIt might still be too early to provide any definitive answers to these and other questions. It is possible, however, to mention some indicators.\nIn a public statement to the Sudanese community in Cairo, Sadig expressed his full support for the Nairobi Declaration 93, in which NDA parties agreed to base civil rights on citizenship, regardless of race or religion and declared that international conventions on human rights would be part and parcel of the future Sudanese constitution. This, of course, is a secular position, but nobody is inclined to call it by that name, because the S word has fallen into disrepute due to the heavy bombardment of the fundamentalists who have succeeded in equating secularism with atheism, thanks to the lowly ceiling of political and philosophical discourse in the area.\nBut Sadig never tires of simultaneously repeating that the NIF government has deformed the 'Islamic slogan' through dogmatism and short sightedness; implying that an enlightened Islamic alternative is still possible in Sudan.\nHe vaguely hinted, of late, in an interview with the Gezira Satellite Channel (GSC), that the Moslem majority in Sudan can satisfy its 'aspirations', i.e.: implementing Islam, democratically, without jeopardizing the 'rights' of non-Moslems - (Those rights presumably fall short of implementing Christianity).\nThese are familiar themes. They represent the basic flaw in Sadig's thought and deed. They are a trade mark for his tendency to have his cake and eat it. Sudanese have always expressed a tendency to look at the luminous side of things and a readiness to engage in wishful thinking. Whether they would rest, content with these contradictions, or whether they would demand of Sadig to spell out very clearly his position on the relation between religion and politics, depends largely on the extent to which they have drawn the right conclusions from their previous experience with him.\n\nAsked about his relationship to the NDA, in the first press conference he held in Asmara, Sadig said he would confer with (them) and seek their advice. The impression he left was that the NDA wan not an 'institution' into which he would fit; but an 'organisation' with which he would deal. Further practice would shed more light on this issue.\n\nTaking his son, Abdulrahman, to Asmara with him, Sadig seems to have left behind, with his other siblings, his seven-year old brain child 'Aljihad Almadani' (Civil Resistance). He significantly asked the armed forces to violently overthrow the government, reminding them that he happened to be the elected Prime Minister and representative of constitutional legitimacy.\nHe coupled that with a national call for 'hijra' in which he summoned all Sudanese youth to join the fight immediately. This is viewed by all as an extremely positive attitude, putting Sadig in the heart of the on-going military confrontation with the regime. His wide ranging diplomatic initiatives have gained enormous weight to the opposition and has put Sudan in the spotlight again.\n\nThere is a danger, however, that Sadig may become the victim of his own success and try to achieve a consensus around his person instead of being part of a national consensus on principles and issues. His not-too-distant history makes that danger real. It is in the best interests of Sudan, and of Sadig himself, if he would treat the NDA as an institution and try to fit into it. This will be highly welcome for all the parties of the opposition. A co-presidentship of the NDA with his friend and long-time ally, Mohamed Osman Almirghani, is something to think about.\n\nConfrontation on the Eastern Border: Has the knell tolled?\nThe importance of the NDA's military victories on the eastern border can hardly be exaggerated. In a sweeping movement across the border, Kurmuk, Gissan, Menza, Yagora, Yabacher, Gadamayeb and others have been captured. The death toll among the government forces exceeded one thousand, others were arrested and almost a thousand of the People's Defence Forces (PDF), suddenly awakening to the real connotations of their name, joined the ranks of the opposition.\nThe Five-Stars-Hotel's opposition proved to be at home in the rough terrain of eastern Sudan; the appointment of Dr. John Garang as military leader proved to be anything else but an empty gesture; and the assistance from sisterly countries was shown to have gone to the right people.\nOn the other side, and from the southern-most part of Sudan, the SPLA has been on the move. The capture of Kaya and Yei is actually opening all the gates for Juba.\nThe government characteristically alleged that a foreign invasion, led by Ethiopia, Eritrea and Uganda, encouraged by the US and Israel, was taking place. Nobody believed the flagrant lie. Many, however, were mystified and confused. The government has previously boasted of divine support; armies of angels were said to fight side by side with the government forces. The flora and fauna of the south were declared government-friendly; trees shouting Allahu Akbar in unison; monkeys self-sacrificially treading on land mines and detonating them. Isn't it strange of such a government to complain and become hysterical when her enemies seek 'human' assistance from their neighbours?!\n\nThese developments have made two points clear:\n1. The viability of the 'military alternative' has been confirmed beyond doubt.\n2. Waging war on two fronts will progressively prove too enormous a burden for the government to pursue for a long time.\n\nStill, important questions loom very large.\n\nThe space available can only allow of a few remarks.\nThe aims of the war should be the destruction of the enemy. Any ambiguity about this might prove disastrous to the opposition. The government with its crystal clear aim of destroying the opposition will have the whole advantage. The Intifada is nothing else but what is happening all over Sudan taken together. The fighters in the south and the east are not preparing for the Intifada; they are making it. Urban masses will follow later.\nThe destruction of Sudan has been going on, by an unprecedented pace, since June 1989. Tens of thousands have been killed; hundreds of thousands injured, forcefully removed; turned in refugees, their homes destroyed; their means of livelihood wiped out. Million others are subjected to a cruel process of gradual death through hunger, poverty, epidemics, insanity and depression. Infant mortality is one of the highest in the world.\nHow can we afford to ignore real destruction to talk about a hypothetical one. If such logic were to prevail, the Hitlers, Chouchescos, Mengistos of the world would have been allowed to have their way. Fortunately it didn't. The Turabis and Bashirs should never be allowed to fair better than their predecessors. As forces of pure negativity, they are destroying our people and country. Standing up to them will, at least, provide some chances for it to rise from the ruins.\nThe acceptance of a peaceful settlement by the NIF can only be dealt with as a highly hypothetical issue. Their past attitudes do not indicate such an inclination. Dealing with the miraculous and waiting for the improbable, the moment of truth is sure to elude them. If they choose, however, and contrary to all expectations, to dismantle their regime, and hand power over to the NDA, and face a fair trial, nobody will refuse the offer. The priority, however, is for the army officers to disengage themselves from the NIF regime and join the opposition, to preserve the reputation of the armed forces and their own personal dignity.\n\nAlthough the opposition is now living one of its best moments, and has enormous chances before it, it is equally faced with serious challenges: the restructuring of the NDA and opening it to non-partisan and professional participation; the reformulation of previous party documents and positions in the light of what has been agreed upon in Asmara; the devising of proper tactics to facilitate disengagement between the NIF and the armed forces. Is the NDA capable and willing to exert efforts required for the solution of those problems and others?.\nThat is the question.\n\n\nAfter several weeks of relative calm on the war fronts in eastern and southern Sudan, renewed fighting had erupted along the Sudanese-Ugandan-Zairean borders in recent days.\nThe Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) led by John Garang, had launched an attack against government forces in southern Sudan, thus opening yet another front, as part of the opposition's overall strategy of its wide-scale offensive, started on Jan. 12 , against Khartoum.\nThe attacks across the southern border came as no surprise, as it had been widely anticipated in light of NDA statements and promise of opening other fronts in southern and western Sudan, and the government media repeated outcries of a massive military build-up on the southern border and of an impending Ugandan invasion.\nThe SPLA forces of about 12,000 fighters, backed by tanks and heavy artillery, launched a simultaneous attack, which started at 5 am on Sunday March 9, on Kaya and the Yei-Juba road. In three days of fierce fighting, the SPLA managed to capture the key army garrisons of Kaya, 30 km from the border, Basi, Morobo and Gumuni on the Yei-Juba road, Loka, Lainya and five other military outposts. The headquarters of the National Tobacco Company near Gumuni is also now in SPLA hands.\nYei, the second largest town on Bahr el-Jebel state and a strategically-important garrison town, fell to the SPLA after 2 days of siege. The government tried to parachute supplies to the besieged forces at Yei, but most of it landed into SPLA hands.\nWith the capture of Yei and Morobo, the SPLA is in control of most of Bahr el-Jebel state, except for Juba, the capital, and Kajo Kaji, in the west bank of the Nile. This leaves Juba in a vulnerable situation as the 100 km stretch of road, from Yei to Juba, is now open to the advancing SPLA forces.\nThe SPLA said it had destroyed in Kaya, Basi, Morobo and Yei, an army division of about 5 to 6 thousand soldiers, including a Major General and nine Colonels.\nMore than 2,000 government soldiers who were fleeing to Juba, were ordered by their HQ in Khartoum and Juba to go to Yei (although the HQ knew it had already been captured by the SPLA) to help the situation there. They ran into SPLA hands and half of them were captured or surrendered and the other half killed or fled. This incident is bound to create a lot of discontent within the army.\nThe SPLA also said it had captured a huge amount of arms including 15 T-55 tanks, six long-range artillery pieces, anti-aircraft guns and anti-tank cannons.\n\nSudan immediately accused Uganda of launching the attack. The Minister of Culture and Information, al-Tayeb Ibram Khair, however, told state television that the rebels used sophisticated weaponry which indicated foreign involvement. 'Uganda does not posses these sophisticated weapons, nor does it have the ability to launch the attack.' he said. The army spokesman, Lt. Gen. Mohamed al-Sanousi, on the other hand, said 'the military equipment used is definitely America's, so are the rations'.\n\nAlthough Khartoum denied it had lost any towns to the SPLA and said the army had crushed an attack by Uganda, destroying tanks and causing a large number of casualties, the army spokesman said 'our fighters are courageously fighting the aggressors on all the battle fronts'.\nInformation Minister, El-Tayeb Mohamed Khair denied that Yei fell to the SPLA, but said they had lost contact with its units. President Bashir, on the other hand, told a meeting of retired army officers in Khartoum that the two commanders of Kaya and Lainya were killed defending the towns and that six other senior officers were also killed at Lainya, Loka and Yei. He vowed to recapture 'in the next few days' all areas held by the SPLA and foreign forces.\n\nUganda denied the charge by Khartoum and in return accused it of violating its air space and bombing northern Uganda. However, Uganda said its troops had sealed the border with Sudan and its senior army commander is in the area to monitor the situation. There are also reports that Ugandan and Sudanese forces had exchanged artillery fire across the tense border on Monday March 10. The loud crossfires were heard in the northeastern Ugandan city of Arua, 80 km south of the border.\nDespite the heightened tension and hostilities, Iran's Foreign Minister, Ali Akbar Valayati, visited Khartoum to follow up on the Iranian mediation between the two countries. While Sudan's foreign minister, Ali Osman Taha, said that the aggression by Uganda have rendered the talks, due to start in Kampala March 13, impossible, the meeting did take place with Sudan represented by First Under-Secretary at the Foreign Ministry, Ali Abdel Rahman al-Numeiri. The meeting ended into a deadlock, with both parties trading accusations.\n\n\n[] Sudan has signed a $7.6 million contract with the British firm Balfour Kilpatrick to supply raw materials to build four bridges. The bridges are part of the 1,205 km Western Salvation Highway which will run southwards from Khartoum and also connect Sudan with its neighbour Chad.\nThe cost of the highway is estimated at $120 million; most of the funds would be contributions by the six states in the Kordofan and Darfur states.\nIt was reported that workers at the Ministry of Roads and Communications pledged they would donate more than $17,000 from their salaries for the project.\n\n[] Sudatel, the privatised Sudanese telecommunication company, had announced that it had introduced mobile telephone service. The service will only cover Khartoum area, and the equipment cost, annual connection fees and call costs will be paid for in US dollars.\nThe marketing manager of the company advised customers not to use their mobile phones in public places and mosques, so as not to provoke jealously from those who cannot afford it.\n\n\nEditor: Ali B.

Plans to break ground are a step closer after recently receiving approval by the State of Wisconsin Building Commission. The next step is to collect bids from companies to design and build the system. The university plans to select a contractor by April to begin construction in June and have the machine ready to use by December.\n\nThe project will digest manure, capturing the methane gas, but plans include a biodiesel manufacturing facility. Glycerin, a byproduct of pressed soybeans, will be added to manure and run through the digester to produce more methane. The digester could also use food waste and whey left from cheesemaking, but the university is limited to using less than 20 percent nonagricultural waste without needing additional permits.\n\nManure from the dairy herd, beef herd and farrow to finish hog operation at Pioneer Farm will be used as the main source of substrate.

{"dataman_score": 4.0, "text": "New to casino games? We have a guide for you\n\nCINCINNATI - With 85 gaming tables, Horseshoe Casino Cincinnati's floor may be a bit intimidating to the novice. Not sure where to start or how to play? We've got a guide to three of the most popular casino games.\n\n\nThe Basics:\n\nAt the most basic, this card game is played between player and dealer with the goal to get the value of cards to equal, or come the closest, to 21.\n\nThe game gets far more interesting and strategic though if all the players play against the dealer. When this is done, the chances of winning increase.\n\nBlackjack is played with one or more decks of 52 cards. Players are dealt two cards, and based on the value of the dealer's show card; they can decide to accept one or more cards to get closer to 21 or stand (which means the player stops accepting cards).\n\nThe Play\n\nFace cards are valued at 10 points. Numbered cards have corresponding values. For example, if a player is dealt a queen and a nine, their hand totals 19.\n\nAces, however, are valued at 1 or 11, depending on the situation. For instance, if a player is dealt an Ace and a five, their hand can either total six or 16.\n\nAn Ace and a five equals six or a \"soft 16,\" meaning even if a player accepts another card, they cannot \"bust\" or go over 21. So, if a player chooses to accept another card (a likely scenario if the player has any desire of winning), and it's a seven, their cards would total 13 \u2013 an Ace, a five and a seven, with the Ace counting as 1.\n\nIf a player's first two cards total 17 or higher, it's best to stick with what you're dealt or stand. The dealer must hit until his two cards total 17 or more, or until he busts.\n\nAs a player, the preference is to have the dealer go over 21 or \"bust.\" If a player is dealt 13 and the dealer's up card is a five, the safest way to play is to always assume the dealer's down card is a 10. In this instance, the players expects the dealer's two cards to total 15 and the wise decision as a player is to stand, hoping the dealer busts on his own and everyone gets paid.\n\nIf a player is dealt 13 again, but this time the dealer is showing a queen or a card equaling 10, the player must assume, or play for the worst-case scenario, the dealer is holding another 10 as the down card or 20.\n\nIn this case, 13 does not beat 20 and the player must hit.\n\nGetting dealt a blackjack - an Ace and a 10 or face card \u2013 wins automatically, unless the dealer also receives a blackjack.\n\nFor blackjack novices, there is a card, or what blackjack players call the \"book,\" that explains every possible scenario on a table. It can be purchased at most casino gift shops and can be used at the table.\n\nThe Odds\n\nA blackjack pays 3 to 2 odds. All other winning bets pay even money.\n\nIf played correctly, blackjack has fairly favorable player odds. The house normally has a half-percent edge over the player.\n\nFor more detailed information on blackjack, visit\n\n\nThe Basics:\n\nCraps is a dice game in which players make wagers on the outcome of the dice roll. Players take turns and play against the house (the casino). Players can bet on the various options by placing chips in the appropriate sections of the board and there are a variety of odds on each bet.\n\nThe Play:\n\nOne central bet all novices can make to ease their way into the game is called the pass line bet.\n\nCraps is played in rounds with the come out roll as the first phase. To start a round, a shooter (the person rolling the dice) rolls and if the two dice total two, three or 12, the shooter is said to \"crap out,\" with the players who bet on the pass line losing their bets and ending the round.\n\nIf the shooter rolls a seven or 11 on the come out, the result is a win for pass line bets. The same shooter continues until he rolls a four, five, six, eight, nine or 10. That number becomes \"the point,\" meaning if the shooter rolls a point number, the pass line bets win. If the shooter rolls a seven, the most common combination of two dice, the shooter craps out and the round ends.\n\nThe Odds\n\nThe house edge for the pass line bet is 1.41 percent. There are various house edge odds depending the bet.\n\nFor more information on craps, visit\n\n\nThe Basics:\n\nPerhaps the easiest game on the casino floor and the one most associated with gaming, the roulette wheel is a series of numbers on black and red squares. Many players play simultaneously.\n\nThe Play:\n\nThere are 38 numbers on the wheel: One to 36, a zero and a double zero. Players may choose to bet on a red number, a black number, an odd, an even, and a number range such one to 18, 19 to 36, 1 to 12, 13 to 24, 25 to 36.\n\nPlayers may also choose to bet on a combination of six numbers or less. Each bet, however, has different winning odds.\n\nThe Odds:\n\nBetting on any one number pays 35 to 1 odds, two numbers pay 17 to 1, three numbers pay 11 to 1, four numbers pay 8 to 1, five numbers pay 6 to 1 and six numbers pay 5 to 1.\n\nBetting on number\n\nranges 1 to 12, 13 to 24 and 25 to 26 pay 2 to 1 odds and all the rest of the bet pay even money or 1 to 1.\n\nThe house edge on all bets is 5.26 percent except for betting on five numbers. Also known as the \"first five\" bet, the house edge on that bet is 7.89 percent.\n\nBelow is a list of other card games featured at the Horseshoe Casino.

My earliest memory of a Brach\u2019s POP display was at the Lucky grocery store by my house back in Westchester (1980). I don\u2019t remember any signage aside from the Brach\u2019s logo, so I never quite understood how it worked; I mean, there were bins and bins of candy right there, unguarded, at my disposal. I didn\u2019t see any prices and I knew that cashiers needed some kind of barcode to scan or code in\u2026so how did they keep track of the Brachs inventory? It was simply too much of a temptation. I wondered, how could they even know if I took one? Just one? There was no way that somebody counted every single piece at the end of the day, right?\n\nWell, eventually, every time my parents sent me to buy groceries (usually milk, since my brothers and I drank so much of it all the time), I would pass by the Brach\u2019s collection, look around nervously with my heart racing, and grab a piece of candy or two. My favorites were the square caramel chews or the neapolitan ones (3-layered chews with chocolate, coconut and strawberry\u2026omg), or the butterscotch drops, or the sugar-coated gummy \u201cbrick\u201d things that were green, orange or purple. There were also these shiny assorted foil-wrapped tootsie-roll looking things called \u201cRoyals\u201d that were awesome\u2014plus, they were skinny enough that I could actually grab a handful without looking too conspicuous.\n\nThis went on for quite some time\u2014months and months, maybe almost a year at least\u2014until one day I finally noticed a large, imposing sign that clearly stated they were sold by weight and to use a bag for purchases. Beneath was also handwritten in big letters, \u201cNO SAMPLING.\u201d I couldn\u2019t have been alone in my misadventures\u2026or was I?\n\nUpdate: Well, well, well. Little did I know that only a click away lies, who not only remembers Brach\u2019s candies like I do, but also has a freakin\u2019 authentic Brach\u2019s salesman display tray from the \u201970s! #$(@$@#$!!\n\nImage via\n\nBrach\u2019s salesman bulk candy display (1970s) \u2013 Image via\n\nAm I not the only one who salivates at the thought of eating some Brach\u2019s candy right now? I can hear each and every crisp and crinkly crack of that cellophane candy wrapper in my little 9-yr.-old hands as I prepared myself for yet another sugary journey to happiness. Ah, sweet torture. Let\u2019s bring \u2018er in for a closer look.\n\nBrach's Royals - Image via\n\nBrach\u2019s Royals \u2013 Image via\n\nYup, those Royals were awesome. I loved their shiny foil packaging and assortment of flavors within them. Truthfully, I often spent some minutes at the store just gazing wondrously into what seemed to be a bottomless bin of Royals\u2026of course, before I grabbed a few and took off. Ah, and my sweet old friends\u2026those \u201cjelly sugar-coated brick things\u201d\u2026well there they are.

Just think\u2014if it weren\u2019t for the web, I probably would\u2019ve never known that those \u201cjelly sugar-coated brick things\u201d were actually called Perkys\u2026annnnd\u2026I wouldn\u2019t have known that they were Brach\u2019s answer to Chuckles candy.

I vividly remember studying the marks my front teeth made when I bit one in half just like that\u2026and wondered if someone could identify me by matching that with my dental records. Yes, I was geeky/dorky like that, and I still am.\n\nI actually don\u2019t remember Chuckles candy, although they do look good. Now I\u2019m hungry.\n\nBefore I go to bed: Months ago I discovered The Candy Wrapper Museum while reminiscing with some co-workers about all the great candy from back in the day. I highly recommend a visit. Just remember to brush your teeth afterwards.\n\nMuch thanks to for this week\u2019s sentimental trip.\n\nRelated Posts with Thumbnails"}

(AP Photo)\n\n( \u2013 Plans to build an oil pipeline stretching from Canada to U.S. refineries in the Gulf of Mexico have been put on hold again as the State Department considers the pipeline's environmental impact on U.S. lands \u2013 a step that is delaying job and economic growth and revenue growth through taxes on the project, say pipeline advocates.\n\nThe latest delay of the 1,700-mile XL Keystone pipeline \u2013 under consideration by Canada and the United States since 2008 \u2013 follows the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s demand\u00a0that the State Department produce a second environmental impact statement (EIS) after deeming the first one \u201cinadequate.\u201d\n\nIn a Mar. 15 statement, the State Department said it would begin accepting public comments on a second EIS in mid-April, and it promised a decision on the pipeline project by the end of the year.\n\n\u201cFollowing issuance of a Final EIS, the State Department will solicit public comment and host a public meeting in Washington, D.C., before it makes a determination under Executive Order 13337 on whether issuance of this permit is in the U.S. national interest,\u201d the statement says. \u201cThe U.S. Department of State expects to make a decision on whether to grant or deny the permit before the end of 2011.\u201d\n\nThe move has sparked reaction from the oil and natural gas industry on both sides of the U.S. and Canadian border, particularly at a time when high gas prices and turmoil in the Middle East are putting pressure on the Obama administration to reduce dependency on foreign oil by developing domestic reserves and partnering with friendly oil resources.\n\nThe American Petroleum Institute (API) called the delay \u201cnew environmental hurdles\u201d to block a \u201cmuch-needed pipeline\u201d that would transport Canadian oil sands crude. \u201cIt is past time for the administration to approve this important infrastructure investment,\u201d Jack Gerard, president and CEO of API, said in a statement issued on the same day as the State Department\u2019s.\n\nTransCanada, the company in charge of the project, noted that Keystone XL \"has been under review since 2008 and we are confident we have addressed the major questions raised by regulators and government agencies,\" Russ Girling, TransCanada's president and CEO, said in a statement. He said he \u201cexpected\u201d to see the project, which is an expansion of TransCanada\u2019s core Keystone pipeline, get under way by 2013.\n\ngasoline prices, gas station\n\n(AP File Photo/Matt Rourke)\n\nTransCanada said the new pipeline would bring more than $585 million in new taxes to states and cities located on its path through the American heartland. An additional $5.2 billion in property taxes would be paid over the proposed 50-year lifespan of the project and create jobs that would provide $6.5 billion in personal income to American workers.\n\n\"Keystone XL is a shovel-ready project that is funded completely by private sector investment at no cost to American taxpayers,\" Girling said. \"It will be a safe, modern and leading-edge pipeline and we have provided the Department of State and other agencies with the facts regarding Keystone XL's design, safety, operating procedures and limited environmental impact.\"\n\nAccording to the Canadian Energy Research Institute, development of Canadian oil sands could create 340,000 U.S. jobs.\n\nLabor unions also support the project, saying it will directly create 20,000 \"good jobs\" for American workers.\u00a0\n\nIn a March 15 statement, Teamsters President Jim Hoffa said he was pleased that the State Department is \"moving forward\" with the pipeline approval process: \u201cIn an ideal world, the United States wouldn\u2019t need to import crude oil from oil sands. We\u2019d much rather rely on clean, renewable resources for all our energy needs. But it will be many years before we\u2019ve ended our dependence on petroleum.\"\u00a0\n\nHoffa also noted TransCanada's \"responsible construction practices,\" and he said allowing the approval process to move forward -- by launching a second EIS -- \"was the right decision\" for the State Department\u00a0to make.\n\nIn July 2010, the EPA sent a letter to the State Department criticizing its original EIS as \u201cinadequate.\u201d The 18-page letter detailed a long list of concerns, including pollution from the refineries, problems with spillage containment in case of an accident, and environmental justice -- in particular \u201cthe potential for disproportionately high and adverse human health and environmental effects on minority, low-income and Tribal populations.\u201d\n\nThe National Resources Defense Council (NRDC), a liberal group, also reacted to the State Department\u2019s decision on Mar. 15, echoing the EPA\u2019s concerns and adding how the pipeline might adversely have an effect on migratory birds and the American Burying Beetle.\n\n\u201cWe trust that\u00a0the State Department will allow the\u00a0draft SEIS\u00a0to\u00a0dictate next steps, rather than impose artificial deadlines that might short change the very issues that\u00a0convinced the State Department more\u00a0analysis was needed,\u201d NRDC staff member Liz Barratt-Brown wrote on the group\u2019s Web site.\u00a0\u201cBut for today, we are glad for all the people who live along the pipeline and in\u00a0Alberta and Texas have made their voices heard.\u201d\n\nAPI\u2019s Gerard cited in his statement that a preliminary report by the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers claims that nearly 1,000 U.S. companies in 47 states currently support Canadian oil sands development and that it would be a boon to the economy, unless the State Department rules against it.\n\n\u201cOil is a global commodity,\u201d Gerard said. \u201cIt will go to where it is welcomed and the capital investments and jobs will go with it.\u201d"}

If you want to control your touchscreen phone without exposing your hands, or paying for specialty gloves, Instructables suggests grabbing a needle, and some conductive thread.\n\nConductive thread\u2014no, we'd never heard of it, either. Instructables user Grathio points us to this explanation at Fashioning Technology, which also suggests where to grab some of it. You won't need to be skilled at sewing to pull off this glove modification, but you will need to take the time to test out what works with your screen. Grathio suggests leaving a wider, messier spread of thread on the inside of the glove to facilitate contact with your finger, but limiting the thread exposed on the outside to a tightly wound circle, about a quarter inch in diameter.\n\nIf you are good with a needle, you'll likely be able to make the end result look a little neater. And if you're really good and want to offer notes to anyone else looking to tackle this project, drop the advice (or link) in the comments here."}

The department offered only one proposal to deal with fraud, and it quickly abandoned the idea after colleges criticized the plan.\n\nBy the end of the fourth negotiating session, last month, the package of rules contained nothing to address a problem that the inspector general says grew by 82 percent from 2009 to 2012. ...\n\nThe extent of the damage done by student-aid fraud isn\u2019t known, but the inspector general estimated last year that as many as 85,000 students may have participated in fraud rings from 2009 to 2012, at a potential cost to taxpayers of $187-million.\n\nThat\u2019s a significant loss, but it\u2019s still a very small share of the $546-billion that the government disbursed in grants and loans during those four years. Some financial-aid administrators say the comparison shows that the problem has been blown out of proportion.\n\nGovernment investigators nonetheless take student-aid fraud seriously. Over the past decade, the Education Department\u2019s inspectors general have testified before Congress five times on the susceptibility of online programs to fraud and abuse. ...\n\nAnd last year, the department began flagging students with 'unusual enrollment histories' for further scrutiny by colleges. If an institution finds, upon reviewing a flagged transcript, that the student hadn\u2019t earned any credits at one or more of the institutions he attended, the college must seek an explanation from him. If the student fails to provide one, the college must deny him aid.\n\nFinancial-aid administrators say many of the flagged applicants turn out to be legitimate students who have struggled academically, racking up debt but little or no credit. But some administrators say the additional work is worth it, even if it catches only a few repeat offenders.\n\n'It is not a burden in the effort to prevent fraud and abuse,' says Richard Heath, director of financial aid at Anne Arundel Community College. 'Even if schools are understaffed, it\u2019s still the right thing to do.'\n\nOther aid administrators feel that federal officials have placed too heavy an onus on colleges while falling short of their own responsibilities.\n\n'The department keeps coming up with all these things schools should do to prevent fraud,' says Karen McCarthy, a senior policy analyst at the National Association for Student Financial Aid Administrators. Some administrators feel that 'perhaps the department needs to be introspective and consider what it could do.'\"\n\nA paid subscription may be required to access this content.\u00a0\n"}

Hilzoy gives a good summary of the issues:\n\nCliff May at The Corner quotes Kimberley Strassel:\n\n\"To kick off our show tonight, Mr. Obama will give 95% of American working families a tax cut, even though 40% of Americans today don't pay income taxes! How can our star enact such mathemagic? How can he \"cut\" zero? Abracadabra! It's called a \"refundable tax credit.\" It involves the federal government taking money from those who do pay taxes, and writing checks to those who don't. Yes, yes, in the real world this is known as \"welfare,\" but please try not to ruin the show.\"\n\nIt is a silly argument, because what Obama's election promise (always to be remembered as an election promise) talks about is something to do with \"working families\", not with \"all Americans.\" Lots of Americans are children, for one thing, and \"families\" often contain more than one person and some of those other members of the family are not actually paying income tax even though the family on the whole is. In short, \"American working families\" is a different counting concept than \"Americans.\" They are both pretty fuzzy concepts, though, when it comes to defining who pays taxes in this country.\n\nMore generally, Americans pay all sorts of taxes, not just the federal income tax. There are payroll taxes, property taxes, estate taxes, sales taxes and so on.\n\nThe argument is silly not only for those reasons, but also because presidential candidates always promise the moon, on platter with parsley nicely next to it, and we know this. McCain's campaign promises have a small mathematics problem, too. Or rather, not so small a problem."}

The part i'm struggling with is how to make the objects/characters (assets) the correct size/dimension to one another and to the game world.\u00a0\n\n\nIf anyone would be able to shed some light on how to do this it would be greatly\u00a0appreciated.\n\n\n\n\n#2 SiCrane \u00a0\u00a0Moderators \u00a0\u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0Reputation: 10172\n\n\nPosted 03 March 2013 - 10:01 AM\n\nGenerally you create an arbitrary scale for your objects and then model accordingly. For example, you might define 1 unit to be 1 inch, so your model for a sword would be somewhere around 30 to 40 units long and a woman might be 70 to 80 units tall. Generally your 3D Software has an option for you to specify the unit to real world scale that you want so that you can model in real world units. Of course different software often ships with radically different defaults (Ex: Carrara uses 1 unit is one inch but Cinema 4D uses 1 unit is one meter). And sometimes the bastards switch from one scale to another between versions (Ex: Poser 5 used 1 Poser unit to be 96 inches but Poser 6 uses 103.2 inches).\n\n#3 wolfgang959 \u00a0\u00a0Members \u00a0\u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0Reputation: 107\n\n\nPosted 03 March 2013 - 11:25 AM\n\nOkay thanks for your help\u00a0that's\u00a0made it a little more clearer to understand, you see i come from a engineering background i design engines and parts in 3D modeling software, and this project has just been a little hobby for me. I'm use to designing things with very accurate measurements and i\u00a0didn't\u00a0think the step from that to this would be so great.\u00a0\n\n\nSo from what your saying am i right in understanding that the game engine (which ever i choose) will also have this unit to real world scale then also. If\u00a0that's\u00a0the case would it be best to find out that scaling first then apply it into the models that i'm going to create, does that make sense?\n\n#4 3Ddreamer \u00a0\u00a0Crossbones+ \u00a0\u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0Reputation: 3282\n\n\nPosted 03 March 2013 - 08:37 PM\n\n\n\n\nI use different methods for sizing and scaling depending on the needs of what is\u00a0most efficient or accurate in the circumstances.\u00a0\n\n\nMy most common techniques:\n\n\n1) Establish the scale of the grid in the program.\u00a0For example,\u00a0in Wings3D\u00a0one\u00a0square in the grid of the viewport is one square meter.\u00a03DS Max, Blender, or Deep\u00a0Explorer have others. \u00a0I have\u00a0measuring tools which I have made in the past which I can quickly bring in to the viewport by importing or opening them in the program.\u00a0\u00a0The\u00a0appropriate ones are chosen, for instance,\u00a010 kilometer one for terrain levels or a height scale for characters (\u00a0These scales\u00a0have\u00a0height and length or height and width measured ).\u00a0 These tools are:\u00a0 image planes, images, tetrahedrons which have been subdivided, or custom made\u00a0measuring jigs for\u00a0unusual\u00a0shapes or measurements.\u00a0\n\n\n2) Sometimes I import a previous made character or other model which is the appropriate or close to the desired size and shape of the new content to be used as a kind of template.\n\n\n3)\u00a0 Parts of previous models may also be used or combined from different models to be used as a template.\u00a0 A case would be a ship which is the same class of build, such as aircraft carrier of a class (Iowa Class Battleships, or other class, are examples) I may use a whole model as a template for a future one or parts of it which are to be the same in the new model.\u00a0 Other times these parts my be transformed while keeping the original dimensions.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\nI always verify the model dimensions with a measuring stick or measuring square (similar to a carpenter's square) before declaring the model finished.\n\n\nStrategic Considerations:\n\n\n1) Generally build and measure the most important parts or art assets first.\n\n\n2) Create the art assets and measure them which are most often viewed or used in the game.\n\n\n3) Always prioritize a process of most important to least important and repeat the cycle until all assets are done:\n\n\nExample of build, measure, and import in to game:\n\na) Terrain (Finish the land closest to the main character first if possible)\n\nb) Main Character\n\nc) Vehicle or building used by the main character\n\nd) Weapons or tools used by the main character\n\ne) Environmental assets used by or closest to the main character, such as rocks, trees, furniture, and so forth\u00a0\n\n\nRepeat the process with the second, supporting, or opposing character and all environmental assets\u00a0like listed\u00a0above here.\n\n\nNote: In some games, the game engine might allow you to resize the art assets after import.\n\n\nAll assets should ideally be measured before you import into game to avoid distracting the artistic train of thought.\u00a0 Try to keep the technical things such as measuring the objects outside the game as much as possible to keep the in game art workflow as pure as possible.\u00a0 This results in most powerful artistic creativity.\n\n\nImportant:\u00a0 The more polygons and other aspects such as ray-tracing (should be avoided most of the time) in an area than the greater the hit on performance, so there are programs which measure these things - an important area of measuring art assets.\u00a0 For example, programs can measure numbers of polygons, vertices, edges, faces, surface area, and surface shader area within a given area or volume of the game scene.\u00a0Some do this by core or threading, too.\u00a0This is advanced but definitely crucial ways of measuring models or other art assets.\n\n\n\n\nEdited by 3Ddreamer, 03 March 2013 - 08:47 PM.\n\n\n\nby Clinton, 3Ddreamer\n\nOld topic!"}

We took the kids to the beach and, of course, the Monterey Bay Aquarium. But the real reason we were in town was to attend the Monterey Beer Fest at the fairgrounds.\n\nMonterey Beer Fest\n\nThe weather was very cooperative and the June gloom was nowhere in sight, instead the skies filled with a brilliant blue and feathery white fluffy clouds. A warm sun with a cool breeze kept the day at a Goldilocks temperature most of the day.\n\nMonterey Beer Fest\n\nThe fest quickly filled the fairgrounds, exceeding the estimated 4,000. Beers from 100 different breweries from around the world were poured and the background was filled with the music of three different cover bands, who channeled the music of Weezer, The Police and Tom Petty.\n\nThe Deschutes Trailer\n\nThe Deschutes Beer Trailer that\u2019s been visiting locations throughout the Bay Area was on hand to pour beer.\n\nThe Brewing Network\n\nThe festival was hosted by Chris Nelson and Merideth Canham-Nelson, who write online at thebeergeek.com. Also on hand was Justin Crossley (far right) with his Brewing Network who broadcast live throughout the festival. Here they\u201dre interviewing Chris and Meredith (far left). You can also listen to the broadcast from Saturday as a podcast.\n\nThe Johnsons\n\nBy far, the best story of the festival was the wedding reception of newlyweds Mitch and Melissa Johnson. They had originally planned on attending the festival but mixed up their dates so both the fest and their wedding fell on the same day. Undaunted, they bought festival tickets for everybody attending the wedding and held their reception right there with 5,000 of their best friends. Now that\u2019s just got to be the beginning of a great life together!\n\nIt really was a beautiful day and a great way to spend it there at the fairgrounds. While crowded in the middle where the beer was located, there was plenty of room to spread out around the fringes. The music was never too loud. There was plenty of food available from local food booths. My two kids had a ball with two friends also there with their parents, running around the grass and exploring each others\u2019 toys. Fun for the whole family.\n\n\n  \u2022 http://www.thebeergeek.com Chris\n\n    Thanks for coming down Jay!\n\n  \u2022 http://www.belukus.net Matt Pushinsky\n\n    The fest was a great success.

I was curious about the bride & groom \u2013 thanks for filling in the story.\n\n  \u2022 http://www.montereybeerfestival.com jeff moses\n\n    J, can\u2019t thank you enough for making the trip down\n    from the Bay Area \u2013 & I\u2019m happy to hear that you enjoyed yourself.\n\n  \u2022 Amy Gutierrez\n\n    Jay, thanks for posting pictures and writing about the festival.

She is a member of Women's Will, and is married with two daughters. She said:\n\n\"Hundreds of Iraqi mothers and wives are, like you, waiting for a knock on the door ...\n\n\"This occupation has destroyed Iraq. Americans don't know that tens of thousands of Iraqis are in prisons. Americans don't know how many have been killed. Lancet reported 100,000 in 2004, not counting Falluja. Now it is something like double this number.\n\n\"Hundreds of thousands of families must search for men who are missing, and they are left with nothing to support themselves.\n\n\"Many people do not know about the bombing of cities. Bush said the war ended on May 1, 2003. That's not true. Many Iraqi cities have been bombed severely. And families are buried in the rubble.\n\n\"'Get the troops back home' is not enough.

Funds? Like government funds? My learning to swim certainly had nothing to do with funding and riding a bike? Please. That consisted of a shove from my dad down a small hill.\n\nIt is America the poor \u2013 we can\u2019t afford to keep our children fit \u2013 and America the fat \u2013 childhood obesity is increasing. What it isn\u2019t is American pride. I can\u2019t imagine anyone calling it that. And I certainly can\u2019t imagine a representative of this country using that paragraph and believing it really represents \u201cAmerican pride\u201d.\n\n\n  \u2022 Facebook\n  \u2022 Twitter\n  \u2022 LinkedIn\n  \u2022 Tumblr\n  \u2022 Digg\n  \u2022 Reddit\n  \u2022 email\n  \u2022 Print\n  \u2022 Google Bookmarks\n\n21 Responses to Our Olympic Pitch? \u201cDo It For The Fat Kids!\u201d\n\n  \u2022 stupid is as stupid does\n\n  \u2022 That is freakin\u2019 embarrassing! Funds drying up? Really?? REALLY??? Seems to me the feds are spending at an ever increasing rate, so where\u2019s the money going?\n\n    \u2022 The feds aren\u2019t spending ENOUGH, so it\u2019s a cut. Get it? Gotta understand how those DC people think.\n\n    \u2022 There\u2019s a mythology or psychology that this stuff was all fully funded at some golden period in the past. Probably just before republican obstructionism.\n\n      I mean, how else did we get to this point? It had to be the government that got us here. There\u2019s no other explanation.\n\n  \u2022 I\u2019m so proud to live in a country where all our children are fat and need the example of foreign atheletes to inspire them to learn to ride bikes, swim, play, and frolic. Oh, and where our government is too broke to give children money to learn to do these things.\n\n    I\u2026 I\u2026 I\u2019ve never been proud of my country until this moment.\n\n    Thank you, Michelle O, for lending your sculpted biceps and dulcet voice to bring American pride not only to Copenhagen, but also to this poor, downtrodden, Bible-thumping, gun-clinging, racist.\n\n    / sarc\n\n    Good heavens, where did this woman grow up? And in what sort of environment? How does a person who grows up in America come to have this view of our country? I will admit that we\u2019re not a perfect country (though I don\u2019t want to live anywhere else, but I will say that Italy is quite nice), but she makes it sound like we\u2019re a more broke, less joyous version of Airstrip One.\n\n    \u2022 Good heavens, where did this woman grow up?\n\n      I can lend some insight. She grew up in the same city as I. In fact, we graduated high school the same year. I was not as fortunate as Michelle though. My parents sent me to a Catholic high school. I\u2019m sure it was tough for them to pay for it, but it was a step up from the publich high school choices. Michelle attended a selective magnet school (which my folks also helped fund). Michelle then attended Princeton. I had the grades for Princeton but couldn\u2019t afford it. Michelle didn\u2019t have to worry about that. So, really, it\u2019s no wonder that Michelle believes that achievement can only come via government largesse.\n\n      And yet she was never proud of her country until her husband was elected. Amazing.\n\n  \u2022 Someone tell me this: is it unpatriotic to root against this country getting the 2016 games? If so, then I am unpatriotic. I want to see The Clown\u2122 and Mrs. Clown\u2122 come home with a dark mood and a sneer, sort of the way Americans feel about them and their crooked maladministration right about now.\n\n    \u2022 You got it all wrong, James. It\u2019s not unpatriotic to root against *This Country*, that of course is still perfectly acceptable.\n\n      No, no, what is unpatriotic in the extreme is for you to root against Mayor-for-Life Jabba Daly\u2019s chance to loot the gold mine he\u2019s been waiting his entire life for, now THAT is unpatriotic!! And doubly unpatriotic of you to even think of suggesting that Han and Chewbacca are doing this just for some kind of political payoff to a machine that they owe great past debts to.\n\n      Perish the Thought.\n\n  \u2022 \u201cThere\u2019s a mythology or psychology that this stuff was all fully funded at some golden period in the past.\u201d\n\n    Excellent point.\n\n    Possibly this was actually true before government salaries become 130% that of private sector comparable jobs.\n\n  \u2022 I wonder if it took all 22 staff members to come up with that comment or whether it was a DIY job.\n\n  \u2022 They cut Federal bicycle funding? AGAIN? Damn those conservatives!\n    And swimming hole funding and subsidies for swim trunks and suits? My GOD! IS There NO LIMIT that these conservatives in control of Congress will stoop to!\n\n  \u2022 Well, at least she\u2019s finally proud of her country. I guess.\n\n  \u2022 I guess it is conservative school boards that are dropping PE and banning kids from running on the play ground playing tag. It might hurt the poor dears self esteem if they get tagged \u2018it\u2019 or nailed with a dodgeball because they didn\u2019t dodge.\n\n  \u2022 I went satirical, rewriting this quote here.\n\n    But after the satire, I looked at what her quote really means\u2026 And this is what I came up with:\n\n    America used to bid on the Games by suggesting that we were the best place to host the Games \u2014 you know, from each according to his ability. Now, on the other hand, we bid based on how much the Games will bring to us \u2014 to each according to his need.\n\n  \u2022 I don\u2019t see the down side of Obama\u2019s Olympic presser. If the IOC awards it to Chicago, it will confirm Obama as the \u201cShill-in-Chief\u201d and expose the IOC as a baldly political organization. If the IOC turns down Chicago, Obama will be diminished as \u201cthe Shill who couldn\u2019t get the job done.\u201d Either way, it a WINRAR!!\n\n  \u2022 After the Salt Lake City Olympics, it obvious that Obama had to show up with a truckload of cash to make any difference.\n\n  \u2022 This woman is unbelievably tone deaf:\n\n  \u2022 I\u2019m not rooting against the United States\u2026\n\n    I\u2019m rooting for Rio\u2026\n\n    Wonder how much of their Carnivale spirit will show up in the opening show."}

But they are concerned about where things are going now if the GOP senators don't defend their turf.\n\nEffectively, in announcing the new bill, Boehner and his deputies backed off a compromise approach they earlier tried to sell to rank-and-file conservatives. Under that plan, the House would have sent two bills to the Senate -- one to de-fund ObamaCare, the other to fund the government. The Senate, then, would have been able to easily bypass the ObamaCare bill and send the spending measure straight to the White House, in turn averting a government shutdown.\n\nBut House conservatives revolted, and Boehner now is tying the two votes together.\n\nBut the plan is undoubtedly risky.\n\nBoth Obama and Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid have suggested Republicans will bear the brunt of the blame if the gambit results in a government shutdown.\n\nObama blasted Republicans during an interview Tuesday with Telemundo.\n\n\"We're hearing that a certain faction of Republicans, in the House of Representatives in particular are arguing for government shutdown or even a default for the United States of America ... if they don't get 100 percent of what they want,\" Obama said.\n\n\nThe GOP measure would fund the government through Dec. 15, at current funding levels. Republicans also plan to push a measure dealing with the debt ceiling, with a mid-October deadline looming for when the government can no longer honor its obligations.\u00a0\n\nFox News' Chad Pergram contributed to this report."}

They have been joined by the opposition Pakistan Muslim League and its leader, Nawaz Sharif, who are furious at moves to bar them from office.\n\nHow will the protests unfold?\n\nThough dubbed a \"long march\", the protests take the form of a motor convoy through the country. It is due to start in the south and culminate in a sit-in outside parliament in Islamabad on Monday.\n\nWhat do the lawyers want?\n\nLawyers are still agitating for the reinstatement of a former chief justice of the supreme court, Iftikhar Chaudhry, sacked by former military ruler Pervez Musharraf in 2007. But President Asif Zardari fears that if reinstated he could rescind Zardari's immunity from prosecution for old corruption charges.\n\nWhy is the confrontation important?\n\nPakistan matters. It is a nuclear power with a burgeoning domestic Islamist insurgency that poses a security risk not just for neighbouring Afghanistan and India, but for countries with historic social and cultural links such as Britain. The US and Britain would rather the country's leadership concentrated on fighting terrorism than each other. An alliance between the democrats following the 2007 assassination of Zardari's wife, Benazir Bhutto, proved all too brief. Analysts are concerned that if the democratic forces self-destruct, the military will step in once again."}

Clearly, that doesn't concern too many of us, since we're still buying plenty of analogue tellies.\n\nThis situation may have got Parliament in a panic but plenty of punters know all they need to go digital is to pick up a set-top box.

So too is the aerial feed. There's an output port next to it, allowing the TVonics device to sit between antenna and telly. There's no Scart connector, but that's the whole point of this box: to bring digital TV to sets that were never intended to be connected to other devices except through the aerial socket.\n\nTransforming your business with flash storage\n\nMore from The Register\n\nnext story\nNeil Young touts MP3 player that's no Piece of Crap\nCrazy Horse man saddles up 'Pono' for digital audiophiles\n20 Freescale staff on vanished Malaysia Airlines flight MH370\nBletchley Park board member quits amid TNMOC split-off spat\nPM Cameron leaps aboard Internet of Thingies\nBugger the jetpack, where's my 21st-century Psion?\nForgotten form factors #2: The handheld PC\nJapanese boffins build 'earring PC' for hands-free computing\nTiny wearable device weighs just 17 GRAMS...\nChromecast rival Streaming Stick even has a remote \u2013 gasp!\nprev story\n\n\nTransforming your business with flash storage\nBuild your sender reputation in four steps\nHigh performance access to file storage\nThe benefits of software based PBX\n5 DNS security risks that keep you up at night"}

They also put up a page that explains how one can obtain Bitcoins and how you can pay for products on TigerDirect using Bitcoins. While I'm not sure if TigerDirect is doing this for marketing purposes or because they want to be Bitcoin-friendly, either way they're going to get a lot of people's attention by assuming such a risk. Now, if they have a method of converting those Bitcoins directly into cash then I don't think they are assuming much risk.\n\nWhile I commend TigerDirect for helping Bitcoin to continue to gain legitimacy (and probably other cryptocurrencies as a side effect), they made a grave mistake on their own website describing Bitcoin. And frankly, it assumes that Bitcoin's computational capabilities and number crunching is actually accomplishing something, but it really doesn't. TigerDirect's post states, \"Bitcoin miners run specific software on their computers to help collectively solve very large and complex problems. Much like \"SETI at Home\" or \"Folding at Home\".\" The problem with this is that SETI and F@H both actually accomplish a beneficial task for humanity or at least attempt to do so through the distributed computing of incredibly complicated deep space signal or protein folding problems.\n\nTigerDirect's QR Code for Bitcoin\n\nIt really bothers me every time that I bring up Bitcoin mining when people ask me what exactly is being done with all of that computational power. And the truth is, nothing other than waste electricity (which adds to the fundamental value of any cryptocurrency). I asked myself this question during the early days of Bitcoin mining and it was one of the reasons why I simply didn't partake. Obviously, this was a foolish decision considering that Bitcoins are now worth in the hundreds of dollars per coin. And at the time I was exploring Bitcoin mining they were relatively easy to obtain but they were incredibly inexpensive and the price didn't justify the electricity consumption and the lack of any benefit to humanity. I've happily done Folding at Home (F@H) in the past with absolutely no monetary gain but still enjoyed donating my computing capacity and paying a bit for the electricity.\n\nHeck, if anything, these projects should introduce their own crytocurrencies that pay people with 'coins' for their work so that there is some intrinsic value to society in the coins. Not to mention the fact that their workloads can vary and some workloads can be paid out with a single coin and others with multiple coins. Anyways, cryptocurrencies have hit certain snags, but they also continue to pick up momentum. Even Airbnb's CEO was contemplating publicly on Twitter whether or not Airbnb should accept Bitcoin as a form of payment.\n\n\nRelated articles:\n\n\n"}

Should we name the 6 Series the 5 Series Coupe instead? If you are going to use alphanumerics nomenclature, make them so that they actually follow a formula. It is bad enough the last two numbers are now nominal displacement and they do not designate body style or drive train type any longer with letters.\n\nI'm sure everyone will welcome the 2 Series since the next 1 Series will be FWD.\n\nRename the 1 Series M Coupe the M1 while you are at it.

Details on what it consists of have been slowly coming out since its major component -- a sandbox mode -- was confirmed in July. The sandbox mode is joined by additional difficulty levels and new weapons, playable characters, and Achievements.\n\nIn announcing early last month that the game had sold one million units, Undead promised news on the DLC would be coming soon after. Details on sandbox mode were published on Undead's website which explained how its difficulty ramps up over time. For starters, fast zombies are encountered more often and fewer vehicles are available for players to get around in. An FAQ posted on the developer's forums further outlined how the progression of sandbox mode works, including what players are allowed to take from one \"town\" to the next.\n\nCoinciding with the launch of the DLC on November 29 is the release of the game's fourth title update. That consists of bug fixes and the new loot system which has been said to be \"designed to make scavenging fairer and more consistent across every player's experience.\"\n\nState of Decay was released on Xbox Live Arcade in June and was followed by a release on Steam (as an Early Access game) in September.

Charlene Billings did a great job at writing this book. I liked the way she stuck with only the important events of Grace Hopper\u00bfs life instead of so much details that I know what they had for breakfast on day-to-day bases. She also did an amazing job at making simple, even mundane everyday experiences seem like major life dictators for Grace Hopper\u00bfs future. For me I liked this book because it was short and to the point. I would recommend this book for people who would want an easy read for a school report. It is also great book for people who are interested in Grace Hopper or are just curious about what she contributed to the world of computers, but don\u00bft want to read an extensive biography of her life. I would not, however, recommend this book for people who want an extensively detailed account of Grace Hopper because they will probably be very disappointed. This is also not a book for someone who is hopping for a lot of details on the computer that Grace Hopper helped build.\n\n    Was this review helpful?

Thu, 18 Jul 2013 18:43:54 +0000 Michelle Keyes Positive adoption language (PAL) means more than just being politically correct, or in the know, about adoption language.\u00a0 It really does have deep seated roots and evokes emotions that affect each member of the triad in a different way.\u00a0 However, the overall consensus is that PAL embraces the true spirit of adoption, particularly open adoption, and uplifts the members of the triad, building self-esteem, confidence, and healing.\n\nPositive Adoption LanguageCommon adoption terms that are confused are:\n\n  \u2022 Placing your child for adoption VS giving up your child for adoption\n  \u2022 Deciding to parent the child VS deciding to keep the child\n  \u2022 Birthmother/birthfather VS real parents\n  \u2022 Adoptive parents VS not the real parents\n  \u2022 My birthson/birthdaughter VS my real or natural-born child\n\nUsing positive adoption language in your home and around your child will have a positive impact on your child\u2019s self esteem.\u00a0 It is important for your child to know the love, care, and concern that went into their adoption plan.\u00a0 Using simple terms such as, \u201cchose to place for adoption\u201d can convey that care and concern.\u00a0 Negative terms such as, \u201cgave up for adoption,\u201d conveys that there was not much thought that went into the decision.\u00a0 It also implies that there was something wrong with the child and that is why they were \u201cgiven up.\u201d\u00a0 Typically, we give up things that are bad for us: smoking, drinking, gambling, etc.\u00a0 Children are not \u201cgiven up for adoption.\u201d\u00a0 The birthparents take painstaking effort to\u00a0 choose the parents they believe will be perfect for their child.\u00a0 There is a lot of love in that process, more than most can imagine.\n\nAnother common distinction is \u201ckeep\u201d the child versus \u201cparenting\u201d the child.\u00a0 It\u2019s not a matter of simply keeping the child.\u00a0 Most birthparents would \u201ckeep\u201d the child if that were an option for them, but they want more than that for their child.\u00a0 They want their child to be parented in a manner that will positively benefit their child and, for whatever their reason may be, they don\u2019t feel that parenting is in their or their child\u2019s best interest at the time of birth.\u00a0 Adoptees also need to learn the language involved in their adoption story and be prepared to share that story with others, as questions and explanations are going to be inevitable.\u00a0 Being armed with PAL will provide the adoptees with knowledge and confidence when talking to others about their adoption story.\n\nBirthparents benefit from the use of positive adoption language as well.\u00a0 Just as it\u2019s important to use positive adoption language with adoptees to help them understand the care and love that went into their adoption plan, the birthparents also need affirmation that the decision they made was done out of love.\u00a0 Birthparents may not have the support of others in their adoption decision and the language that is used can also affect their self-esteem and feelings surrounding the adoption.\u00a0 Using positive adoption language can help birthparents in the healing process.\u00a0 This will in turn effect their comfort level with embracing their role as a birthparent, both in society and in their birthchild\u2019s life.\n\nAdoptive parents can also heal from the adoption experience by using positive adoption language.\u00a0 Adoptive parents are affected by the birthparents\u2019 grief and also need to understand that the birthparents really do entrust their child to them and want their child to be raised in that specific family.\u00a0 Adoptive parents need to have the affirmation that they are their child\u2019s parents.\u00a0 They need to be prepared with the right language to speak with their family, friends, and child.\u00a0 Positive adoption language fills that need.\u00a0 It is important that family members and friends are familiar with positive adoption language.\u00a0 The adopted child could easily ask any one of them about their adoption, or talk with them about their story.\u00a0 If the family member or friend uses terms that are negative, the child will likely internalize that and begin to doubt the truth of their positive adoption story, or feel they did something wrong to be placed for adoption.\u00a0 Since the child\u2019s best interest is at the core of adoption, especially open adoption, it is imperative that they grow up surrounded by positive adoption language.\n\nAs an adoptive family, is it important to begin getting accustomed to using this language early in your adoption process so that once you do adopt, it will be natural for you.\u00a0 It also gives your family and friends time to hear you use the language, talk about it if everyone is open to discussion, and also gain familiarity and comfort with using the language themselves.\n\nEveryone benefits from positive adoption language, or PAL.\u00a0 It\u2019s important to be mindful of how your language affects others, and more specifically, that it does in fact affect every member of the triad, members that all deserve the utmost respect for their part in the process of adoption.\n\n]]> 0\nGeorgia\u2019s HB-21 Signed Into Law Thu, 09 May 2013 18:00:31 +0000 Michelle Keyes May 6th was an important day in Georgia state law: HB 21 was signed into law by Governor Deal, making post adoption contract agreements legal in the state of Georgia. This endeavor began earlier this year when Representative Mary Margaret Oliver introduced the bill after being approached by Judge Michael Key of Troupe County. There was much controversy in the adoption community over this bill in the beginning. However, after much discussion, research and testimony, it gained acceptance and understanding, passing the House and Senate before becoming law.\n\nHB21 Signing Ceremony\n\nIAC\u2019s Michelle Keyes at the signing ceremony (2nd to the right of Gov Deal)\n\nThere are numerous advantages to having legally enforceable post adoption contracts, while the disadvantages are hard to determine. Adding a legal backing to the agreement between adoptive parents and birthparents validates their commitment to each other and helps ensure the genuine commitment to an open adoption plan. Adoptive parents will have peace of mind, knowing the commitment that their child\u2019s birthparents have made and having an outline of what the contact will look like filed with the courts. Birthparents are often skeptical that the adoptive parents they choose will cut them out of their lives after the placement. Having their contact agreement filed in the courts and seen as a legally enforceable contract will solidify the commitment the adoptive parents are making with the birthparents. The children of open adoption are going to benefit knowing that all their parents cared about them and loved them enough to take the time to outline their commitment to each other. Birthparents will likely be more willing to choose Georgia adoptive parents, creating more families in Georgia. In addition, this bill helps validate and protect the work that open adoption agencies perform.\n\nIn cases where the children are older when placed for adoption, such as when in the care of the State, this new law may make the transition easier for birthparents to relinquish their rights. More birthparents may be willing to make an adoption plan that is in the best interest of their child if they know that they will not lose contact with their child. Representative Oliver is currently working with the Department of Family and Children Services to find the best methods to implement this new law into practice.\n\nWithin the law, there is room for modification and enforcement. It specifically outlines who may be a party to the agreement, who can request it be altered, and who can request it be enforced. As it currently stands, only the adoptive parents can file a petition seeking modification. In the future, this may be one area that is asked to be altered. The law also outlines that any party, as defined in the bill, may seek enforcement or termination of the contract. Any changes to the post adoption contract agreement must be found to be in the best interest of the child. If the agreement is not followed or is altered, an adoption cannot be overturned. Having a post adoption contract agreement is optional; not all agencies, adoptive parents, and birthparents will choose to engage in this contract. However, if they do, and it\u2019s filed with the courts, it will be legally enforced.\n\nYou can read the full text of the law here:\n\n]]> 0\nHow to Find the Right Adoption Match Fri, 05 Apr 2013 18:07:18 +0000 Michelle Keyes Most every prospective adoptive parent anxiously waits for their first contact and hopes that the first contact will result in a match and eminent placement.\u00a0 While this has, and does happen, it is more realistic to prepare for multiple contacts before finding the right match.\u00a0 Are you on the adoption journey with the first person you ever dated?\u00a0 Most likely not!\u00a0 Finding the right match is often compared to dating and finding the right partner; when it\u2019s right, you usually know it.\n\nIs this the right adoption situation?Unfortunately, you don\u2019t have much control over getting a contact (although networking can increase your chances), but that doesn\u2019t mean that every contact is the right one for you.\u00a0 In the waiting stages of the journey, it can be hard to imagine turning down any potential situation.\u00a0 However, this can be necessary.\u00a0 It is important to be honest with yourself in how you feel about a contact and if it doesn\u2019t feel right, it\u2019s not right.\u00a0 While prospective adoptive families often feel bad about turning away a potential birthmother, if you try to force a match, it will likely fall apart at some point.\u00a0 If she\u2019s not the right match for you, there is likely another family that she is the right match for.\u00a0 Keep in mind that sometimes the right match turns out to be something that you didn\u2019t anticipate and really surprises you.\n\nThink about the things that are important to you in a match, things you are open to considering, and things you would not proceed with.\u00a0 Since potential birthmothers will be contacting you, and not vice versa, you will also need to think about what you are flexible on.\u00a0 For example, while you might love to have a contact in your same state, are you open and able to travel to another state?\n\nSome things to think about when talking with birthparents:\n\n  1. Can you see yourself being friends with this person?\n  2. Can you see your family and friends welcoming her/him into their circle?\n  3. Do you share common interests and beliefs?\n  4. Are you comfortable with the amount of contact she/he is wanting and are you realistically able to agree to it?\n  5. Are you willing to embrace this potential birthmother\u2019s child, including race, ethnicity, prenatal exposures, mental health history, and physical health history?\n  6. Are you comfortable letting the birthparents make decisions that are right for them, even if you would choose something different?\n  7. Are you comfortable, based on the information you know about the birth family and the situation, moving forward?\n\nWhen talking with a potential birthparent, realize that she/he might not know what she/he really wants either.\u00a0 The birthparent might have ideas in mind about what she/he wants, but might not have received education and counseling about open adoption yet.\u00a0 They might not understand what is typical, acceptable, or reasonable.\u00a0 For this reason, it\u2019s important to not dismiss a situation or commit to anything without first consulting with a counselor. Most situations are going to have some details that will need to be worked through with the help of the agency and counselor.\u00a0 Afterwards the situation may end up being more acceptable to you.\n\n]]> 2\nGeorgia\u2019s HB 21: Post Adoption Contracts Tue, 26 Mar 2013 17:40:09 +0000 Michelle Keyes Georgia House Representative Mary Margaret Oliver introduced a bill in February 2013 that would, if passed, make post adoption contract agreements in Georgia legally binding. Her interest in initiating this bill stemmed from Judge Michael Key, out of Troup County, who\u2019s experience in the courts led him to believe this would be beneficial.\n\nGA Rep Mary Margaret Oliver\n\nGA Rep Mary Margaret Oliver\n\nThe interest in this bill has been immense, and since it was first introduced, has caused lively discussion in the Georgia adoption community. There have been avid supporters, as well as some staunch opposition. At this stage, HB 21 is in Senate Rules Committee, awaiting approval for a Senate vote. If it passes the Senate, HB 21 will be erected into law.\n\nThe Independent Adoption Center is an active supporter of HB 21. We believe that having a legally enforceable post adoption contract agreement, also known as open adoption agreements, is favorable to the adoption triad.Research has already proven that open adoptions are in the best interest of the children of adoption and having a legally enforceable post adoption contract agreement solidifies the concept of open adoption. The children of open adoption benefit from having people in their life who care about and love them. They will know the love that went into their adoption plan when they see that their birthparents and adoptive parents cared enough about them to make a plan in writing about having contact for the next 18 years. The birthparents of open adoption benefit from the healing and comfort that ongoing contact often brings. The adoptive parents of open adoption benefit from the comfort and knowledge that their child will have ongoing contact with their birthparents and that the birthparents have agreed to continue that contact. While adoptions are built on trust and honesty, having a legally enforceable post adoption contract agreement will comfort the triad in knowing that loss of contact, without just cause, will not be tolerated.\n\nNot only do legally enforceable post adoption contract agreements benefit the triad, they also benefit the agencies, attorneys, and counties that provide adoption services. Agencies such as the Independent Adoption Center, who specialize in open adoption, receive some validation and protection in the work we do. It essentially recognizes the foundation of the work we perform in the eyes of the law. For other entities that work in adoption, and open adoption, this law will also offer them the same benefits. In cases where the county is involved in the adoption, there is a great possibility of increased rewards. If birthparents who have children in the foster system could be given the option of staying in their child\u2019s life, with a guarantee of the law on their side, they would likely be more willing to voluntary terminate their rights rather than having to go through the pains of involuntary terminations, which also affect the children they are trying to protect. In cases in the foster system, this also is logical since the child likely had contact with one or both birthparents prior to removal, and very likely had been having ongoing visitation as their case has progressed in the system. Cutting ties involuntarily and immediately upon birthparent termination could have detrimental affects on the children, as well as on the birthparents.\n\nThere are currently 26 states that have a similar statute on the books. There is a rising interest on the part of birthparents to choose adoptive families who will be finalizing their adoption in one of these 26 states so they are ensured their best interests are protected. If Georgia signs this bill into law, we will be helping prospective Georgian adoptive families by being able to offer this to their potential birthparents.\n\nIt is important to know that having a legally enforceable post adoption contract agreement cannot be contingent on placement of a child through adoption. Birthparents cannot be promised contact if they decide to place. It is a separate acknowledgement that comes with the adoption and can be decided on before or after birth. If contact is not upheld, the adoption cannot be overturned. The party that feels the agreement is not being upheld may file a motion in the court to have the agreement reviewed and case heard. If there is just cause for lack of contact, it would be discussed at that time with a judge overseeing the dispute. If the agreement needed amended, it could be done so at that time with the help of the courts, a mediator, agency, or attorney. A judge could also refer the case to mediation before being heard in a court of law.\n\nIt is also important to note that legally enforceable post adoption contract agreements are optional. If an entity does not want to offer this as part of their services, they do not have to. If any party of the triad does not want to participate in the agreement, one does not have to be done. It is only for those adoption entities and members of the triad that want a legally enforceable post adoption contract agreement. These agreements can even be helpful for a triad that prefers a closed adoption. This could be documented in the agreement and filed with the courts so there is no confusion or claim of a promise of contact that is not being upheld.\n\nHB 21, a proposed bill for legally enforceable post adoption contract agreements in Georgia, would offer the citizens of Georgia a great service. It offers protection, healing, and comfort to the adoption triad as well as validation and options to adoption entities. It is hopeful this bill passes the Senate and enacts into Georgia law.\n\n]]> 1\n\u201cMom, Why Don\u2019t I Look Like You?\u201d Fri, 17 Dec 2010 19:11:04 +0000 Michelle Keyes Caucasian mother with adopted African American child\n\nA single Caucasian mother with her African-American son adopted through the IAC\n\n\nThe key to answering any question about adoption from your child is honesty. If your child asks you about where their looks came from, or why they don\u2019t look like you, you\u2019ll want to go back and revisit their adoption story with them. Remind them that they have birthparents and that they likely resemble them more than you. If you have photos of the birthparents, pull them out and compare them to your child. Notice the differences and similarities between them. If you don\u2019t have photos of them, or of only one of them, you can help your child imagine what they might look and what traits they might share. Give your child permission to daydream about their birthparents and acknowledge that they do share the same genetic background.\n\nYou can also take this opportunity to explore the differences and similarities between your child and the rest of your family. Perhaps you share eye color, or curly hair, or rosy cheeks. Perhaps you share silly talents such as touching your nose with your tongue or wiggling your ears. Or you might even share other interests such as sports, music, or math. Your child is likely trying to find something to connect them to you since they know they are not genetically connected.\n\n]]> 4\nUsing Positive Adoption Language Wed, 01 Dec 2010 17:38:31 +0000 Michelle Keyes Just as with everything else these days, there are \u201cPC\u201d terms to use in the adoption world. While it may seem insignificant, the words you use when referring to your child\u2019s adoption will greatly affect their self-esteem and self-image.\n\nYour child/ren will learn to speak about their adoption based on the words they hear you using, so it\u2019s important to use the correct terms from the beginning. It\u2019s also important to talk to your friends and family about positive adoption language so they will know the correct terms to use as well. This will help them not only be good examples for your child, but will also put their minds at ease as to what the correct terms are to use. It can also take away any uncomfortable feelings they might have when talking to you and your family about adoption.\n\nSome examples of positive adoption language are using the word \u201cplace\u201d instead of \u201cgive up\u201d when referring to your child\u2019s birthparent\u2019s choice to make an adoption plan. You usually \u201cgive up\u201d things that are bad-you give up smoking, drinking, gambling, etc. Using that term could make your child think they are bad and that\u2019s why they were \u201cgiven up\u201d. If instead you use \u201cplaced for adoption\u201d, it acknowledges the loving, thoughtful choice that the birthparents made to find the perfect family for their child. Some other terms to keep in mind are: \u201cparenting\u201d vs. \u201ckeeping\u201d; \u201cbirthmother\u201d and \u201cbirthfather\u201d vs. \u201creal parents\u201d; and \u201cadoptee\u201d vs. \u201cadopted child\u201d.\n\n]]> 5\nTalking to Children About Adoption \u2013 Part 4 of 4 Sat, 20 Nov 2010 00:05:27 +0000 Michelle Keyes If you are adopting and have other children, either biologically or through adoption, you will need to prepare them for the arrival of a sibling through adoption. If your other child/ren is/are adopted, this is going to bring up questions about their own birth and adoption story. It\u2019s going to be a good opportunity to talk about things that perhaps haven\u2019t been discussed in a while. You also will need to think about and possibly discuss how this next adoption may look very different than theirs. The contact with birthfamilies is likely to be different in these adoptions and if the subsequent adoption has more contact then the earlier one, this may be a hard thing for your child to understand. Be prepared to answer your child\u2019s questions and allow them to grieve the loss of contact.\n\nIf your previous child/ren is a result of a biological birth, you\u2019re going to need to prepare your child for the way an adoption works. They will need to learn about different ways families are formed and explore with them how you will be welcoming another family into yours. There are also children\u2019s books about this subject that can provide easy conversation starters.\n\nIn either scenario, it\u2019s imperative that your child be involved in the process of the adoption, while still being protected from realities that they may not yet understand. For example, the wait in an adoption can be long (at the IAC, the average wait is 6-18 months) and a young child doesn\u2019t yet have the concept of time or of waiting. While you want to prepare your child for an eventual placement and explore what being a big brother or sister is all about, you don\u2019t want to allow your child to think this is something that is going to happen immediately.\n\nOnce you are matched with a potential birthmother, you can begin to make more plans and allow your child to become more involved. They will likely meet the birthmother and birthfamily and be a part of the match process. However, as is the reality of adoption, even though she has chosen your family to adopt her unborn child, she has to make that choice yet again when it comes time to sign the relinquishments. One way to prepare your child for this and for the possibility that she may not place is to explain that she has chosen your family to care for her child until she decides if she can. Once she has signed and the revocation period is over, you can talk to your child about the permanency of the placement. If she does choose to parent, your child (and you) will likely be hurt and disappointed, but you will both be better prepared knowing that you were helping her while she needed time to decide what\u2019s best for her and her child.\n\n]]> 1\nTalking to Children About Adoption \u2013 Part 3 of 4 Thu, 18 Nov 2010 00:29:49 +0000 Michelle Keyes If your child\u2019s birthparents close off contact at some point, it\u2019s important to let your child know that they are always welcome back. Let them know that their birthparents still have your phone number or address and if you\u2019ve moved, that you\u2019ve provided the agency with your new information so they can get it when they are ready. Even if you\u2019ve had to establish some boundaries with the birthparents, you likely haven\u2019t said, \u201cDon\u2019t visit\u201d, you\u2019ve more likely said, \u201cWhen you are ready/able/stable, you are welcome to visit again\u201d.\n\nYour child should have all the information about their adoption story before they are 12. You don\u2019t necessarily have to tell them every single detail in adult language by that time, but there shouldn\u2019t be any surprises after that age. Once children are teenagers, they have a wide range of emotions and trust issues. If they learn new alarming information regarding their story, they may misinterpret it, embody it, or not believe you. You will need to continue to process their adoption story over and over again as they age and mature. What satisfied them when they were 3 is not going to satisfy them when they are 5, 8, 12, etc.\n\nGiving your child the power to decide whom to share their adoption story with is very empowering. Not everyone needs to know they were adopted. Let them decide whom to share with and you may be surprised by their choices. It\u2019s important to teach your child the difference between secrets and private matters as well. Secrets can often be bad, whereas private matters are just things that are not shared with everyone. For example, the cashier at Wal-Mart doesn\u2019t need to know your whole adoption story if you do not want to share it, so that\u2019s a private matter. There\u2019s nothing wrong with keeping things private and you are proud to share their story with those people who are important in your lives, but you needn\u2019t be pressured to indulge curious onlookers.\n\nTo be continued\u2026\n\n]]> 6\nTalking to Children About Adoption \u2013 Part 2 of 4 Fri, 12 Nov 2010 23:32:22 +0000 Michelle Keyes When talking to your child about their adoption story and you are discussing the circumstances around the placement, be honest with your child, but keep it age appropriate. Again, try to incorporate examples from every day life to make it easier to understand. For example, if your child\u2019s birthmother was young, you could use an example of a young neighbor or cousin and talk about how \u201cAmy is still living at home with her parents. She goes to school, has homework, is on the cheerleading squad, etc. Could you imagine her trying to raise you right now?\u201d That\u2019s going to make more sense to your child than just saying \u201cShe was too young to take care of you\u201d. Your child is going to also realize that if she was young when she had him/her, she\u2019s not young anymore and could possibly care for him/her now. It\u2019s important to stress the permanency of adoption and that she knew it was a forever decision then and was, and still is, happy with her decision. If ongoing contact is part of your adoption, this is only going to be reinforced through visits and contact. If financial burden was part of your child\u2019s adoption story, it\u2019s ok to share that with your child, but don\u2019t over emphasize it because the next time you tell your child you can\u2019t afford something, they could begin to worry that you cannot afford to care for them and they may be placed for adoption again.\n\nIt\u2019s important to bring up the subject of your child\u2019s adoption periodically, especially if it\u2019s not something they do on their own. It doesn\u2019t have to be made into a big discussion, but a simple thought said aloud, perhaps wondering what their birthparents are doing now or commenting that your child is especially gifted in a certain area and perhaps they share that trait with their birthmother/father. Bringing up the subject is going to give your child permission to bring it up. It will let your child know they can talk to you about their adoption story and ask you questions. It\u2019s also important to let your child know that you cared and continue to care for their birthparents. This is going to give your child permission to care for or love their birthparents and birthfamily. Some children may be afraid of hurting you by loving them, so it\u2019s important to allow them to acknowledge how they feel.\n\nIt\u2019s also important for both parents (if you are a two-parent household) to bring up the subject with your child. It\u2019s going to be natural for your child to come to one of you over the other for different subjects (math homework, sports, friends, etc) and that\u2019s ok. However, it\u2019s important for your child to know that they can talk to either one of you, even if they prefer to always come to one of you.\n\nTo be continued\u2026\n\n]]> 2"}

Land recently wrapped up a three-month deployment to the region, where its crew conducted a series of security cooperation activities. The deployment included port visits to Senegal, Sao Tome and Principe, Gabon, Ghana, Angola, and the Republic of the Congo.\n\nU.S. Navy training teams helped their West African counterparts increase their capabilities in damage control and ship maintenance. They provided survey teams to help develop more accurate navigational charts. They also helped the African navies build leadership within the ranks and strengthen their noncommissioned officer corps.\n\nMeanwhile, U.S. Navy leaders met with senior navy leaders from more than 20 African countries in Nigeria during the late May Seapower for Africa Symposium to encourage them to work cooperatively to promote regional security. \"No single country can do it alone, including my own,\" Adm. Henry G. \"Harry\" Ulrich III, commander of Naval Forces Europe, which has operational control of operations in most of Africa, told the group.\n\nThe USS Land's deployment and maritime symposium were the latest in a series of engagements that Rowden said are building important new relationships in the Gulf of Guinea. \"One of the important things we need to realize about operating in Africa is that the personal relationships are absolutely vital in order to be able to begin to understand how we can best assist them in building that maritime capacity and capability,\" he said.\n\nThe African sailors have \"tremendously\" received the U.S. sailors, Rowden said.\n\n\"There's no better ambassador for the United States of America than the sailor of the United States Navy,\" he said. \"I was absolutely blown away by their ability to go out and make friends and the willingness on their part to give.\"\n\nContact Author\n\nAdm.

His sin had cost him his child, his freedom--and the love and trust of his wife, Jess. After prison Scott was a changed man, but would his faith be enough to heal Jess's shattered heart and gain her forgiveness? \"Crossroads\": Summoned to the school principal's office, single mom Tess Lockwood was surprised to find a handsome man behind the desk. Cop turned educator Mitch Jackson wanted to help--and began to believe that Tess might be God's way of teaching him to love again.\n\neBook Publisher: Harlequin/Steeple Hill, Published: 2008\nFictionwise Release Date: January 2008\n\n2 Reader Ratings:\nGreat Good OK Poor\n\nChapter One\n\nThree years.\n\nThree long, lonely years.\n\nThree years without freedom.\n\nThree years without the woman he loved.\n\nThree years of hell.\n\nAnd now they were over.\n\nScott Mitchell turned and took one last look at the bleak gray walls of the high-security prison where he'd spent the past three years of his life.\n\nWhere he'd reached such depths of despair that he'd seriously considered suicide. Where he'd spent agonizing hours reliving the tragic accident that had taken the lives of two innocent people.\n\nWhere he'd lain awake night after night yearning for the tender touch and sheltering arms of the woman he loved\u2026tormented by the knowledge that she never wanted to see him again.\n\nWhere he'd finally found something to cling to in a long-neglected interest in horticulture, a hobby that became a passion and offered a temporary escape from the drab walls to a world of color and beauty and new life.\n\nWhere he'd acknowledged his mistakes and straightened out his priorities.\n\nAnd most important, where he'd slowly, one tentative step at a time, rebuilt his faith and reconnected with his God.\n\nScott drew a deep, cleansing breath as he stared at the hellish place that, ironically enough, had put him back on the road to heaven. But it had been a harsh, brutal journey. The abrupt transition from power lunches to prisoner, from a world where individual rights reigned supreme to a world where no rights existed had been harrowing. He'd been stripped of his dignity, reduced to a number, looked upon with contempt. He'd lost everything he ever cared about\u2014and that didn't mean the designer suits or sports cars or country-club membership he'd once valued so highly. No, the loss was much more basic than that\u2014the people he loved and his freedom. Dear God, how he'd missed those two things, which he'd always taken so much for granted!\n\nBut never again, he vowed. He was a different man now, with solid priorities and two very clear goals.\n\nFirst, he intended to make his faith the guiding force in his life.\n\nSecond, he intended to win back the heart of the only woman he'd ever loved.\n\nThe first would be easy.\n\nThe second would take a miracle.\n\nBut Scott believed in miracles. He couldn't have survived these past three years without one.\n\nYet winning back Jess's love would take a miracle greater even than survival. He knew that. But with the Lord's guidance and grace, he believed it was possible. It had to be. Because on a spiritual level, he needed her forgiveness and love to complete his redemption. And on a very basic human level, he simply needed her.\n\nAnd so he closed his eyes for a moment and prayed silently. Dear Lord, show me the way to prove that I've changed, that my remorse is real and that I'm worthy of her love. Please give me the courage to persevere and steady me when I stumble. Don't let me lose heart if success is elusive. Help me remember that You are with me always, even on my darkest days, and that with You by my side, anything is possible.\n\nAnd then, with one last look at the forbidding walls, he stepped out of prison and into a new life.\n\n* * *\n\nToday was the day.\n\nThe man who had killed her daughter was free.\n\nJess Mitchell drew a long, unsteady breath and involuntarily tightened her grip on the coffee mug. Scott\u2026her husband\u2026the man she had once loved with all her heart\u2026was free. And she hated him, with every fiber of her being. He'd destroyed their marriage and robbed her of the child of her heart, cutting short a life that had barely begun\u2014as well as the life of a respected judge who'd died behind the wheel of the other car. That, too, had been a tragic loss, for he had been a man of principle and honor, a crusader for justice who had earned a reputation for integrity and courage.\n\nAs far as Jess was concerned, Scott deserved to rot in prison for the rest of his life.\n\nHer hands suddenly began to shake and she carefully set the mug down, the taste of bitterness sharp on her tongue as she struggled to control a surge of anger\u2014the same anger that had been her constant companion in the months following Elizabeth's death. Gradually a dull numbness had taken its place, insulating her from pain and allowing her to better cope with the world around her. But now the anger was back, and with it the raw pain.\n\nReaching out an unsteady hand toward the small glass-topped table in her breakfast nook, Jess shakily lowered herself into a chair. The February day was cold but bright, and a shaft of early-morning sun beamed through the skylight, illuminating the single daffodil in the bud vase in front of her. Gently she reached over and touched the delicate petals, so lovely but so fragile. There was something inspiring about daffodils, she thought with a bittersweet pang. The first harbingers of spring, they bloomed gloriously despite the risk of frost, announcing to those grown weary of the long, dark days of winter that the world would soon be warm and bright again. Perhaps that was why she had chosen this blossom for her table, she reflected. To give her courage to get through this difficult day.\n\nJess forced herself to take a deep, calming breath, thankful that at least she could once again find pleasure in the beauty of nature. She'd always loved flowers, and she was grateful that her work as public relations manager at the botanical garden gave her a ready supply.

Taxes and duties vary from country to country, as do inspection requirements and documentation. Conducting local market research determines the financial implications of procuring particular components in different countries.\n\nPublic relations. Moving project cargo on shared roads often raises public safety and environmental concerns. Even the slightest perception that communities will be impacted deserves attention. An open dialog among all parties involved can help assuage potential PR problems before they flare up.\n\nCargo design. Transportation can sometimes dictate how a product is manufactured\u2014for example, whether it is delivered as one unit or produced in multiple parts and assembled on-site. Project cargo buyers can conduct transportation analysis and create routings before equipment is even sourced or manufactured.\n\nMode optimization. Transit times and requirements vary widely for road, rail, air, ocean, or inland barge. Transportation specialists with in-country knowledge can advise on length, width, height, and weight restrictions that may necessitate using one mode of transportation over another.\n\nChange orders and delivery timelines. Any changes or delays in material sourcing plans or production and delivery can produce unintended consequences. Changing sourcing locations can increase lead times and transportation costs, for example.

However, building a lined cell in Cody would mean a significant increase in costs.\n\nCurrently, the landfills of Park County charge $60 for every ton of waste dumped. Based on numbers run by Richard Thiel, a solid waste engineer, that cost could double, and will almost certainly rise.\n\n\u201cNothing we do is going to beat $80 a ton,\u201d said county landfill Manager Dave Hoffert. \u201cAt absolute worst \u2014 if we do everything wrong \u2014 it's going to be $120.\u201d\n\nIf those numbers hold true, it would likely mean a $3 to $8 increase for Powell residents' monthly garbage bills. That would not include the increased cost of transporting the trash to Cody.\n\nThe changes are the result of Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality policy that essentially mandates that all landfills in the state be lined. The goal is to stop any contaminated liquids (leachate) from leaking into surrounding soil and groundwater.\n\nIn the past, it was believed that the state's climate was too dry for leachate.\n\n\u201cThen some fool lined a landfill and it filled up with leachate. And we can't say that anymore,\u201d Hoffert said.\n\nThe DEQ is providing funds for landfills to work together and plan their long-term futures. Park County, with five waste sites, Powell, Cody, Meeteetse, Clark and Crandall, qualified as a work group.\n\nCommissioner Jill Shockley Siggins said that if the state wants landfills lined they should be prepared to help pay for it.\n\nThe state has an emergency landfill fund set aside for natural catastrophes, such as an earthquake. Siggins said the price hike for residents should qualify as such a crisis.\n\n\u201cIsn't this pretty catastrophic?\u201d she asked. \u201cThat's a lot of money to be going to the citizens and saying, \u2018pay up.'\u201d\n\nPart of the cost of building the lined site in Cody is the expense of getting the money for construction. The state provides loans with low 2-percent interest for landfill projects, but Siggins said the state's surpluses are such that it should be providing money, not loaning it.\n\n\u201cThere's no reason to be borrowing money when we (as a state) have it,\u201d she said.\n\nLining the Powell landfill would be a much more expensive endeavor than Cody's.\n\nThe Powell site is now permitted by the DEQ to run through August of 2010. To stay fully open past that date, the DEQ has indicated that the facility must get a liner \u2014 basically, a one-eighth inch thick plastic tarp.\n\nHowever, the liner requirement only applies to municipal solid waste \u2014 the \u201cwet garbage\u201d that comes from residences, restaurants, and businesses. The landfill receives about 6,200 tons of municipal solid waste each year.\n\nThe Powell site would likely still accept construction and demolition materials, even after \u201cclosure.\u201d Construction and other dry waste, made up of things like sheet rock and furniture, accounts for roughly 4,000 tons a year of Powell's annual 10,200 ton total. Additionally, things like grass clippings, petroleum-contaminated soil, and animal carcasses, could also still be accepted.\n\nThiel said it is possible to install a liner in Powell.\n\n\u201cThe punch-line is, it's a very expensive landfill to develop,\u201d he said. In particular, the rockier geology makes it a tough site to dig and further develop.\n\nHoffert said it wouldn't make sense to have Powell operate on its own with a liner.\n\n\u201cPowell has a lot lower volume. As you decrease your volume, you lose your economy of scale,\u201d he said.\n\nThe economy of scale plays a big role in the cost. Hoffert said each 1,000 tons you add cuts roughly $5.50 from the per-ton cost.\n\nThiel's numbers say lining Powell just for itself would require charging $202 a ton over the next 25 years at the landfill gate \u2014 more than triple the current rate.\n\nAssuming all other factors remain constant, that would translate to a $20 a month increase on Powell residential garbage bills. The current rate \u2014 which includes recycling and collection charges \u2014 is around $22.60.\n\nPeak said the landfills in Billings and Worland have both said that they will not take Park County's waste. That leaves the only other real option as trucking the waste all the way to Casper. Thiel said that option would not require any upfront borrowing, but would make the county dependent on gas prices and Casper's fees. Additionally, the numbers say that would be a higher per ton cost.\n\nIf Powell's waste is to be trucked to Cody, Powell sanitation superintendent Darrell Rood said it may be necessary to construct a transfer station. It would temporarily house and collect trash. Rood sees problems with the city directly trucking its collections to Cody.\n\n\u201cI can see where we're going to have a lot of partial loads,\u201d he said. \u201cI don't think that would ever fly.\u201d\n\nRood said he currently deals with partial loads, but with the Powell landfill only five or so miles away, \u201cNow it's not a big deal.\u201d"}

{"dataman_score": 4.0, "text": "SHOULD solar energy shining down on crops be considered an energy expenditure when figuring the net energy gain of producing ethanol from corn? Most reasonable people would say no. But others with close ties to the oil industry think differently. Take, for example, anti-biotechnology researcher David Pimentel and Tad Patzek, a former employee of Shell Oil and paid consultant to Shell and Chevron.\n\nPatzek and Pimentel recently teamed up to produce a study on the net energy balance of ethanol. Gaining considerable national attention, the study alleges ethanol production requires more energy than the resulting ethanol fuel contains. Despite a wealth of research to the contrary, Pimentel has repeatedly made this same assertion in the past.\n\nTo set the record straight, the National Corn Growers Association has compiled information that questions Pimentel's and Patzek's credibility as well as the oil industry's influence on these studies. Meanwhile, numerous government and university studies demonstrate ethanol's positive energy balance.\n\nTo read the NCGA report, visit"}

They did not release any identifying information or additional details.\n\n\"Being a sensitive 15-year-old is difficult no matter who you are,\" said Sanders, who represents Katherine Jackson, a guardian of Paris and Michael Jackson's two sons, Prince and Blanket. \"It is especially difficult when you lose the person closest to you.\"\n\nParis' uncles Tito, Marlon and Jackie echoed that sentiment in their statement Wednesday: \"Thank you for the outpouring of concern and support for Paris \u2014 she is safe and doing fine. We truly appreciate you respecting our family's privacy at this time.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Paris hinted at her state of mind on Twitter, posting, \"I wonder why tears are salty?\" followed by lyrics from the Beatles' song \"Yesterday\": \"yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away, now it looks as though they're here to stay.\"\n\nSince Michael Jackson's death in 2009, Paris has emerged as the most visible of his children, granting interviews to Oprah Winfrey and Ellen DeGeneres, appearing in magazine articles and amassing more than a million followers on Twitter. She has also expressed interest in starting a singing career and has plans to star in a movie.\n\nA 20-minute video of the teen applying makeup was posted to YouTube last week. It shows Jackson in what she describes as her bedroom playfully demonstrating how she does her eye makeup. She also makes goofy faces and says, \"I need serious help. I'm crazy!\"\n\nParis wrote on Twitter that she doesn't know how the video, in which she repeatedly asserts, \"I am so weird,\" ended up on YouTube.\n\n\nKatherine Jackson shares guardianship of her son's three children with the singer's nephew, TJ Jackson.\n\nParis and Prince are listed as plaintiffs in a lawsuit filed by their grandmother Katherine Jackson against concert giant AEG Live LLC, who she claims is responsible for her son's death. The lawsuit claims AEG failed to properly investigate the doctor convicted of causing the singer's death, and pushed the superstar to rehearse and perform a planned series of 50 comeback shows titled \"This Is It.\"\n\n\nMarvin S. Putnam, a defence attorney for AEG Live, joined in the family's calls for privacy.\n\n\"There's a real person involved here,\" Putnam said. \"There's a 15-year-old girl and something incredibly tragic has happened that none of us know why and I think it would really be in everyone's best interest and particularly in her best interest if rather than blowing this up into something else, that they were given a little bit of privacy to deal with something that has to be a tragic, tragic moment for all of them.\"\n\n\"She's 15,\" he said. \"Someone should give her a break.\"\n\n\nClick here to report a typo or error\n\nThe Canadian Press\n\u00a9 The Canadian Press, 2014\n\n\nWe've improved our comment system.\n\nAdd a new comment.\nYou must log in to add comments.\nCreate a new account\nForgot password?\nLog In\n\u00a9 2014 Dougall Media."}

You have to actually think and try to figure out where things will be in the future.\n\nThe most difficult thing for an investor to learn is patience. Sometimes you may have to wait for years for something to occur which you know should and will occur.\n\nLook at the dot.com bubble. People who did not put money into these stocks were told they were \"out of it\" and that they just \"did not get it\".\n\nThe traders told them that new technology had changed the rules of the game forever. Now that the internet was here, the sky was the limit. You could pay anything for an internet stock because it would grow, like Jack's beanstalk, to the sky.\n\nBut then that fairy tale hit reality. Companies providing free services on the internet turned out to be worth no more than people paid for their services. And the internet bubble blew up in January 2000.\n\nBut investors had been forced to endure three years of being laughed at before proven to be right. The dot.com traders finally \"got\" it and they got it good.\n\nAnd then there was, of course, the housing bubble. Once again, investors were forced to endure three years of being laughed at again because they did not \"get\" it. After all, who didn't know that house prices in the United States always go higher. Like Jack's beanstalk.....\n\nBut then the housing bubble burst in 2007 and the believers in fairy tales \"got\" it again.\n\nWhat are investors waiting for now?\n\nFor the next bubble - the US bond market - to burst. Again, it will probably take several years of enduring derision of not \"getting\" it.\n\nThe weavers of fairy tales on Wall Street have created another wonderful delusion. This time it's a scary tale.....\n\nIt's a tale of monster called deflation. Deflation as in Japan...nevermind that the demographics in Japan are nothing like those in the United States.\n\nIt's a tale of a declining economy and oh my gawd - falling prices! Nerermind that the only falling prices are prices of assets, like houses, that were priced at bubble levels.\n\nEven the US government's own distorted measure, the CPI - consumer price index - shows no scary deflation monster.\n\nOver the past 10 years, the CPI is up 29%. It is only down 0.6% from its record high and yet that is being called deflation.\n\nYes, and it is such scary deflation that the Federal Reserve must keep rates near zero and everyone must purchase bonds to protect themselves against deflation.\n\nPatience, investors. This bubble will eventually burst and bond holders will \"get\" what they deserve.\n\nInvesting Site @ BellaOnline\nView This Article in Regular Layout\n\nContent copyright \u00a9 2013 by Tony Daltorio.

LP to PR is a problem\n\nPaulVincent: secondary issue - research topic\n... far more likely to want to handle PR in logic\n\nChristian: compliance doesn't necessarily require symmetry\n\nMarkProctor: PR can be extended to handle logic, but doesn't come out of the box\n... look at modern PR systems\n\nChristian: simple way to exchange rules that produce the same results?\n\nMarkProctor: don't seem commercial demand for bi-directional interchange\n... but definitely doable with some work\n\n<Harold> Christian, Mark, how would you do both of these, even for facts only?

{"dataman_score": 4.0, "text": "Snowy morning triggers nine traffic accidents\n\nPosted: Friday, December 10, 2004\n\nThursday morning's snowy commute didn't seriously injure anyone, but it kept police busy.\n\nPolice responded to nine accidents with at least some damage between 7:51 and 10:17 a.m. Lt. Walt Boman said the number of accidents was higher than he could remember this season, and most of the incidents were clearly weather-related.\n\nIt's troubling because there is always the potential for more serious consequences, Boman noted.\n\n\"If someone slides into a guardrail and bounces back into traffic, they are at the mercy of other drivers,\" he said.\n\nWith temperatures warming during the day, the commute home was less eventful. Sgt. David Wrightson said police were investigating just one report from the afternoon. Apparently a car slid off Davis Road, a side street in the Lemon Creek area, he said.\n\nMost of the morning accidents police reported were on Egan Drive, which can't be avoided by people driving downtown from the Mendenhall Valley or Lemon Creek areas. Police reported:\n\n\u2022 At 7:51 a.m. on inbound Egan in the Twin Lakes area, a 17-year-old boy was driving a 1992 Honda Civic that reportedly struck a 1991 Plymouth, driven by a 50-year-old woman.\n\n\u2022 At 8:09 a.m. on inbound Egan in the Twin Lakes area, a 30-year-old woman was driving a 1996 Honda that collided with a 1985 Ford truck, driven by a 54-year-old man. The woman was cited on a speeding violation.\n\n\u2022 At 8:24 a.m. on inbound Egan near Norway Point, a 1991 Ford Explorer, driven by a 41-year-old woman from Petersburg was reported in the ditch.\n\n\u2022 At 8:40 a.m. on inbound Egan near Sunny Point, a 50-year-old woman reportedly lost control of the vehicle she was driving and left the roadway.\n\n\u2022 At 8:48 a.m. on inbound Egan near Willoughby Avenue, a 2001 Ford, driven by a 34-year-old woman, reportedly collided with a 1985 Mercedes, driven by a 52-year-old man.\n\n\u2022 At 8:53 a.m. on inbound Egan near Yandukin Drive, 17-year-old boy driving a 1995 GMC Jimmy reportedly lost control, causing the vehicle to leave the road.\n\n\u2022 At 8:54 a.m. in the 9000 block of Mendenhall Loop Road, a 1990 Plymouth, driven by a 33-year-old woman, reportedly slid into a 1996 Chevrolet Suburban, driven by a 35-year-old woman. Police cited the driver of the Plymouth on charges of driving without a license and carrying no proof of insurance.\n\n\u2022 At 9:07 a.m. on inbound Egan and Channel Vista, a 1988 Ford, driven by a 25-year-old woman, reportedly stuck a 2004 Subaru Legacy, driven by a 33-year-old man. Police cited the woman on charges of careless driving and carrying no proof of insurance.\n\n\u2022 At 10:17 a.m. on Glacier Highway and Jordan Avenue, a 1995 Chevrolet, driven by an 80-year-old man, reportedly slid into a 1991 Mazda, driven a a 32-year-old man.

Like you said new ideas and concepts usually take a decade or so to become products. By then the demand might be gone or something else could beat them to it.\n\nBut I think what you would have heard about 4-5 years ago was the scientific breakthorough of discovering halographic storage or perhaps a proof of concept. This article however implies that they are far beyond that, that they have a functional disc. If their claims that it uses technology that is similar to current optical drives then this might not be more than a few years away from consumer use.\n\nRE: Flash pwns this stuff\nBy Alexstarfire on 4/30/2009 5:59:03 AM , Rating: 2\nNot sure what he read, but what I read about 4-5 years ago was a prototype, not some theoretical process. It did read at a slower than a snail crawling in molasses rate of 3 kb/s on a disc that stored more than even top of the line Blu-Rays discs we can purchase today. It was not yet practical by any means.\n\nRE: Flash pwns this stuff\nBy CascadingDarkness on 4/30/2009 10:25:03 AM , Rating: 2\nI second that to an extent. Not because I really need to caress my game discs.\n\nSteam and others have made huge improvements. It's easy to pull down all the games I use after a format, but the day Steam some how dies, if I can't get copies of those games, I'm coming after someone.\n\nThat is why I ran out to get a physical copy of Empire Total War. Not because Best Buy grants me the USS Constitution (though that is a bonus).\n\nRE: Flash pwns this stuff\nBy invidious on 4/29/2009 3:11:28 PM , Rating: 3\nYes, cost will be in optical disc's favor for the near future for sure. This is mainly because of the optical disc's passive nature. The disc itself doesnt do anything, it is acted upon. A flash drive has to have a controller inside of it. This makes the flash drive prone to ESD and water damage. While an optical disc is only vulnerable to heat and physical damage, of which the flash drives are also vulnerable to, though to a much lesser extent with phyiscal damage.\n\nSo for the same size you could have the cheaper optical disc or the more expensive and easier to damage flash drive. I am not saying the flash drive is the \"wrong\" choice, but it definately it not without its drawbacks. Optical is going to continue to have a market.\n\nRE: Flash pwns this stuff\nBy Avitar on 4/30/2009 5:21:38 PM , Rating: 2\nEver hear of the Next Computer? Steve Jobs developed it after the suits bounced him out of Apple to put \"professional\" management in place in the 1980's. (Of course now he owns the suits ) He centered the Next Computer around network communications because he believed back then as you do now. Networks have never developed with the speed he expected and the one useful thing about the Next Computer is that it was the development platform for the World Wide Web and the first web pages in 1992.\n\nThe behavior of businesspersons is just wrong for a network centric system, there will always be someone trying to game the system, illegally or legally, for advantage. Even within enterprises you find that linking documents to data slows systems because the management decisions cut the per person IT expenditure by $10 dollars per year will slow the network response time from ten second to an hour. Until we have multiple fiber optic based ISP competing for the business of providing Network connections for households and businesses the business models will always cause the MBA to short change the network user, because they can get away with it.\n\nRE: Flash pwns this stuff\nBy rippleyaliens on 4/28/2009 11:37:16 PM , Rating: 2\nFlash may indeed pwn this, BUT, once again, Flash still has problems.

Internet delivery cannot do that yet. With talk of isp's capping their download, you can count me out of that one. Flash is fast, RAM DRIVES make flash drives look like hard drives, of yesteryear.. NOW THAT IS POWER!!!!!.\nFlash drives are just the next logical step. Getting there, but at a pace, that is just reasonable, will take 3-4 years, before we see ssd drives take over hard drives in sales..

While apartments, townhouses, and single family homes all have their pros and cons, many single expats and couples alike are looking into and choosing a guesthouse for both short and long term stays.\n\nA guesthouse is roughly the Indonesian equivalent to a bed a breakfast. Usually the guesthouse is in a renovated large older Indonesian home where some of the family bedrooms or a new wing of the house are turned into fully furnished guestrooms. Accommodations include breakfast in a shared dining room.\nGuesthouse Facilities\n\nGuesthouses vary widely in the facilities that they offer, so don\u2019t assume they\u2019re all the same. Better guesthouses offer full facilities which could include: fully furnished rooms, en suite bathrooms, telephones in each guest\u2019s room, television with cable TV, ensuite refrigerator, air conditioning, and coffee / tea making facilities in the bedroom and/or breakfast area. Internet Wi Fi may be provided as well with paid, limited, or unlimited usage for guests.\n\n\nEach guesthouse offers a range of services, depending on their management and policies. Some are just strictly bed and breakfast and you\u2019re left on your own for all other services. At the high end of the spectrum, the better guesthouses offer the equivalent of full hotel services.\n\nIn these full-service guesthouses, rooms are cleaned daily by housekeeping staff, just like at a hotel. Most guesthouses offer laundry services for a set fee. Some even offer the usage of a fully equipped shared kitchen for those guests who enjoy cooking.\n\nSome guesthouses even offer an on-site Coffee Shop with beverages, light meals, and snacks. Ask about other food/beverage options and the availability of neighboring restaurants when you inquire about a guesthouse\u2019s services.\n\nSecurity Concerns\n\nBe sure that the guesthouse has a strict security policy, and enquire about their on-site security staffing as well as if they have closed-circuit TV for monitoring the residence.\n\nWhat benefits can guesthouse living offer me?\n\nThe primary benefits of staying in this type of accommodation, as opposed to renting an apartment, is the cost factor. When you rent a house/apartment you have all the additional utility/running costs of electricity bills, water bills, household staff/cleaning service, laundry, garbage collection, internet, security staff, etc.\n\nOf equal benefit is the fact that guesthouse stays can be shorter in term, with no need to sign multi-year contracts or pay large sums of rent money up front. Guesthouses residents enjoy the flexibility of moving in and knowing exactly what their monthly accommodation cost will be Also guests don\u2019t have to worry about purchasing furniture and other furnishings, as you would have when you furnish a household.\n\nOf equal benefit will be the small community of residents in the house. Living in a home-like environment makes it easier to practice Bahasa Indonesia and get to know other people in a more relaxed situation. Many expats also make friends with the other residents of the house.\n\nSome companies hold corporate accounts with guesthouses, as they recognize the flexible benefits for their corporate guests and their employees.\n\nIndonesian Indekos \u201cKos\u201d\n\n(Indonesian Bed and Breakfast)\nAn Indonesian indekos is a big step down from a guesthouse, as normally the facilities are very minimal. This is the preferred housing for much of the low-salaried office staff who aren\u2019t able to reside with their families. It often consists of a row of small rooms and a shared bathroom at the rear or side of a house.\n\nHowever, some nicer kos can provide an excellent option for a lower income expat English teacher, volunteer worker or someone studying on a fellowship in Indonesia."}

He was known as Cantinflas.\n\n\nThere are two stories about how he chose that name. One story is that his family regarded show business as less than respectable, and so he changed his name in order to avoid bringing shame upon them. The other is that, at one of his first nightclub engagements, a heckler taunted him with, \"En la cantina, tu inflas!\"\u00a0 For some reason, this taunt amused him, and he shortened it into Cantinflas.\n\nCantinflas began his career when he was 16 years old, as a song-and-dance man in \"carpas,\"\u00a0 He was also a circus clown,\n\nHis early films include \"No Te Enganes Corazon/Don't Deceive Yourself, My Heart\" (1936) and \"El Signo de la Muerte/Sign of Death\" (1939), but it was \"Ahi Esta el Detalle/There Is the Detail\" (1940), which began his reign as the Spanish-speaking world's most popular comic.\nHis characters defended the weak, touched our hearts, and had a problem keeping their pants up.\n\nCharlie Chaplin himself, upon seeing the work of his younger Mexican colleague, called him \"the greatest comedian in the world.\"\n\nOne of Cantinflas' trademarks was his rapid talk as he outsmarted\n\nIn his honor, the Spanish Academy created a verb, cantinflear, the meaning of which is to talk rapidly, yet what you're saying doesn't make any sense.\n\nBy the mid-50s his fame from films including \"Un Dia con el Diablo/A Day with the Devil\" (1945) and \"El Bombero Atomico/\n\nInstead, Cantinflas returned home to Mexico, continuing his collaboration with director Miguel M. Delgado which had begun in 1942 with \"El Gendarme Desconocido/The Unknown Policeman\".\n\nCantinflas spent much of the 1980s involved in philanthropic work, especially for the benefit of children\n\nCantinflas, who died a multi-millionaire at the age of 83, never forgot where he came from. Much of his money was given over to charitable work.\n\nHis adopted son, Mario Arturo Moreno Ivanova, a graduate of Betty Ford Clinic, was once wed to a former Miss Guanajuato, who wrote a tell-all book about their marriage. After his father's death, Moreno Ivanova became involved in a twelve-year, multiple-party struggle over the rights to the Cantinflas films.\n\nIt is sad that the son did not share his father's sense of irony, as when he made the pithy comment:\n\n\"El mundo deber\u00eda re\u00edr m\u00e1s. Pero despu\u00e9s de haber comido.\" (The world should laugh more. But after having eaten.) -- Cantinflas\n\nviernes, 28 de septiembre de 2012\n\nMy Job\n\nHi, Ignacio!\nGreat to hear from you.Guess what-I\u00b4ve got a summer job I am working at\u00a0\u00a0Savannah G.\u00a0city I am teacher of\u00a0\u00a0 Spanish It\u00b4s amazing this city.\nIn the morning,I usually greet\u00a0 children.I answer their\u00a0 doubts about the Spanish show them\u00a0 where buy books for they study.In the afternon\u00a0 I help\u00a0 them with theirs homework.We\u00b4re always busy.\nso I get very tired!So far,I\u00b4m really enjoying the job!You need a lot of experience and\u00a0 you must\u00a0 be\u00a0 spanisch\u00b4 teacher\u00a8.I\u00b4m working there for another two months.\nWy don\u00b4t you apply for a job there too?

I did take photos of Lusaka Kanyama Area when I was visiting with an NGO through which I sponsor kids. I am highly ambivalent about slum tourism. On the one hand, yes, it is a source of business (in which case, it should be more than \u00a320 a pop and there should be direct contributions to projects) in areas that otherwise survive mostly on informal economy and illegal trafficking. On the other hand, poverty is not a spectacle and the people living in these quarters are trapped there by poverty.\n\nAnd yes, if you\u2019re European, it is impressive in a horrific kind of way. But let\u2019s face it: we go spend 2 weeks in nice resorts, attended to by locals at our beck and call. And then, we spend a couple of hours in the slum for the authenticity. And we cough up a little money (a drop compared to the cost of a safari) to take care of the white guilt and pretend we made a difference.\n\nPosted in Poverty, Social Inequalities | 2 Comments \u00bb\n\n2 Responses to \u201cThe Uses of the Periphery \u2013 Slum Tourism\u201d\n\n  1. \u00a0\u00a0Dangger Says:\n\n    I had a similar feeling when I was in Rio:\n\n    They offer tours that are \u201cbeneficial to the community\u201d and \u201cnot voyeuristic at all.\u201d\n\n    I didn\u2019t take the tour but I do remember being very ambivalent about it.

As a sociologist, I want to see this stuff and I want pictures to share with my students who have no idea how most of the world lives.\n\n      But then, slum people are people, not illustrations of global poverty so that I can make a point, especially without their consent.\n\n      That\u2019s why I was not really offended when I went to visit a Masai village in Amboseli, Kenya, and it was clear that tourists were treated as a source of money and nothing else. It\u2019s only fair, in my view.\n\n\nLeave a Reply"}

I will use for my example a young lady from Ohio that is a senior in high school and wants to attend college as an engineering major. I will take you, and her, inside the world of college planning by focusing on four key areas.\n\nThe Four Key Components of College Planning\n\nCollege admissions, financial aid, \u201ctax aid\u201d and the personal resources that families have to pay for college costs are the four key components in determining what I call, Your Best Strategy\u00ae. We can simplify the complex world of college planning by focusing on those four components, and simplification is very important because all of those areas are interconnected; change one and you can change them all,\u00a0 and they are all subject to different sets of rules for different situations, and at different colleges.\n\nBut wait, what could be so hard? She has good grades and test scores. Just pick five or six universities with well-known engineering programs, apply for financial aid, and make sure you don\u2019t save in her name. If you did save in her name, then you should move the savings into an annuity so that she will qualify for more financial aid. That may be common advice, but not necessarily good advice.\n\nTake a look at the basic demographic, financial and academic information of the student and her family below, and let\u2019s dive in.\n\nImportant note: While this example uses a family income of $90,000, many students from households with income of even $200,000 are qualifying for need-based aid these days because the sticker prices of some colleges have climbed north of $55,000 per year. And that \u201caid eligible\u201d income level goes up even higher if the parents have two or more children enrolled in expensive colleges at the same time. So this example may apply to you even though your income is above $90,000 per year. Of course your assets are counted in aid eligibility too.\n\nHousehold size 3; Parent\u2019s adjusted gross income $90,000; Parent\u2019s savings and investments (non-retirement)\u00a0 $100,000; Parent\u2019s home equity $125,000; Student\u2019s income $0; Student\u2019s savings and investments $20,000; Grade point average (unweighted)\u00a0 3.7; ACT score 32\n\nThe Bad Advice\n\nTo help pay for their daughter\u2019s education the parents are pledging $55,000 of their $110,000 in savings and investments, and $800 per month from their income. Due to bad advice however, the parents are moving their daughter\u2019s $20,000 in savings into an annuity, because they were told they should not have saved in her name for financial aid purposes. You complete the FAFSA, submit it, and the data from the FAFSA goes into a formula (federal methodology) that determines the student\u2019s expected family contribution (EFC). EFC is the minimum amount the family is expected to contribute toward the cost of college. The colleges then subtract the student\u2019s EFC from their cost of attendance (COA; total cost for everything), to determine if a student demonstrates a need for financial aid. Cost of attendance \u2013 expected family contribution = need based aid eligibility.\n\nBy stashing the daughter\u2019s money in an annuity (a type of insurance contract) \u00a0it will not be counted on the FAFSA (federal aid form), thus \u201chiding\u201d the asset from being reported on the federal aid form and lowering the amount the family is expected to contribute (EFC) toward the cost of college from $22,398 per year to $18,398; thereby increasing the student\u2019s aid eligibility $4,000 per year. Notice I said the student\u2019s \u201caid eligibility\u201d increases by $4,000 per year, not the student\u2019s actual aid award.\n\nHowever, the daughter\u2019s $20,000 will not be available for funding her college costs because if you stash an asset in an annuity (a type of insurance contract), you don\u2019t want to cash it during college or the distribution from the annuity will need to be reported the following year on the aid form, and the strategy will backfire because her aid eligibility will go back down in subsequent years.\n\nTrue, the student\u2019s aid eligibility will be $4,000 higher by putting her $20,000 savings account assets into an annuity, at least when using the FAFSA aid application and the federal methodology for calculating EFC. The primary downside, however, is that the $20,000 will not be available to pay her college costs; only the parent\u2019s $55,000 in assets and $800 per month from their income, and although her aid eligibility increased, there is no guarantee at most colleges and universities that she will receive an additional $4,000 in aid per year, or what type of aid it will be: Grants, scholarships, work-study or loans.\n\nPost Your Comment\n\nPlease or sign up to comment.\n"}

There\u2019s really not much more to it than that. And the article even admits that several times.\n\nAfter quoting a HuffPo person saying that Aol brought in a \u201cweird corporate culture,\u201d the piece then adds that this isn\u2019t that surprising given that Aol is a giant corporation. Then a\u00a0HuffPo employee bitches that they got stiffed when\u00a0the office was restructured, but that\u2019s immediately followed by another \u201cinsider\u201d offering a perfectly good explanation as to why that happened.\n\nThe article doesn\u2019t really say anything.

This is the text (roughly) of the talk I am going to give.\n\nHenry Jenkins, the author and leading thinker, in an act of absolute bravery, attempted to define \"convergence.\" Here's what he came up with:\n\n\"[Convergence is] the flow of content across multiple media platforms, the cooperation between multiple media industries and the migratory behavior of media audiences who will go almost anywhere in search of the kinds of entertainment experiences they want.\"\n\nThis represents the most complete definition of a term that we've used for years, but often at only the most basic levels. But Henry has given us a cornerstone upon which we can start trying to build some plans, products, strategies, and solutions, and we owe him a debt of gratitude. But, we also owe him some closer examination, because he's talking about us here, and we should ensure that we're good with what's he cooked up.\n\nThere are three big players in this definition: media platforms (and those who create and market them), media industries, and media audiences.\n\nLet's start with the platforms.\n\nThe absolute truth is that the next generation of television sets that will soon arrive in stores and in homes will connect to the Internet. Many do already, thanks to set-top boxes, gaming systems, and network-able Blu-ray players. This is the big upgrade that I made this year to my own home and I'm totally blown away by it. The experience of browsing a catalog of movies from the Internet, clicking a button, and having it stream (wirelessly!) to the TV is pure magic. It's one of those things that I know how it works, but remain amazed that it works.\n\nAdd to players like Hulu, Boxee, and SkyFire, and we find a very different media space compared to five years ago. The convergence of platforms, I dare say, is complete. Good work, platform owners!\n\nThe next item in our list is media industries. More specifically, Henry is calling for the \"cooperation between multiple media industries.\" That, unfortunately, is not going so well. Thanks to Herculean efforts on the part of companies like Roku (a platform owner), we are able to get content from a good number of providers. But, let's be honest here: the ability to stream on-demand movies from Netflix is nearly overshadowed by the absolute crap choices it provides. The catalog is throttled by a complex set of ownership rights that seem nearly unbreakable. Anyone who streams a movie from Netflix suddenly finds those red envelopes an annoying anachronism. Media owners, you have a long way to go.\n\nHow about those media consumers? They remain the lifeblood of this thing, and it has become crystal clear that they are in fact willing to go anywhere to get content. In fact, many of them have absolutely no problem circumventing the frustrations of the media owners. Lots of very reasonable people, who would never take anything from an actual store without paying for it make daily visits to BitTorrent sites to download movies, which - let us be brutally honest - is stealing. There is a feeling of justification, though, for many of these media consumers because, simply, they don't see other options, because the media owners can't sort out a model that makes sense to them.\n\nThere is, though, one more point in this definition of convergence that we have been working on, and that is the wonderful phrase \"migratory behavior.\" Maybe Henry is simply turning a phrase and using migratory as a synonym for move, but really migration is much more than that. It is movement to a more suitable environment. That is, this is movement to gain some benefit. And, more specifically, no animal migrates alone. They migrate in packs.\n\nAnd that is ultimately what is different and new about this well-worn word, \"convergence.\" Now we get to have people moving into a media space with their herd. It's why people want to not only get Netflix on their television, but also YouTube and - most importantly - Facebook and Twitter. People want to surround their content with their people. They want to tell the world what they like and hear back more suggestions. They want to know immediately if something is worth investing their time in.\n\nThe converged consumer is coming, and she is not coming alone. As marketers, we are in a wonderful and unique position, with regards to convergence, because we can finally begin to think beyond just plopping some bit of content on one device or another. Rather, now that we really have all three players - media platforms, media owners, and media consumers - in the same space, we can let them interact, grow, and create something that we never would have predicted.\n\nSES London Last Week to Save on SES London Tickets!\n*Saver Rates expire this Friday, Dec 13.\n\nCOMMENTSCommenting policy\n\ncomments powered by Disqus\n\n\n\nGet the ClickZ Marketing newsletter delivered to you.

Do it one by one, all of the files newly created + the ones you downloaded. be extra careful once you rm one file that is gone for ever.

Noland has recommended that all 68 spaces in the nearby city lot at the corner of Butler and Second streets also be converted for monthly lease.\n\nThe municipal lots off Front Street next to Armory Square and adjacent to the Putnam Bridge would also include monthly rental spaces-15 out of about 33 in the Putnam Bridge lot, and 28 out of 77 spaces in the Armory Square lot, according to a preliminary plan from Marietta Safety-Service Director Jonathan Hupp.\n\n\"The administration believes this would create a revenue stream enabling the city to maintain the lots as well as pay for enforcement,\" he said.\n\nFact Box\n\nParking changes coming\n\nMarietta City Council plans to add several monthly paid parking spaces in municipal parking lots.\n\nThe spaces, currently only located in the Parking Partners Lot, lease for $25 a month.\n\nCity officials say additional monthly rental spaces in lots at Butler and Second streets, Armory Square, and next to the Putnam Bridge would generate revenue to maintain city parking lots and hire up to two part-time parking enforcement officers.\n\nEstimated cost for the salaries of two officers would be approximately $30,000 a year.\n\nIn addition to creating more leased spaces, council may increase the time limit on non-leased parking slots from the current two hours to three hours.\n\nThe parking changes could become effective by the first of the year.\n\nSource: City of Marietta.\n\nOther city parking areas, including the Ohio River lot just south of the Lafayette Hotel, a lot beneath the Washington Street Bridge, and the large lot near the Indian Acres Park boat ramp, may also be considered for leased parking.\n\nHupp and Noland said in addition to more monthly space rentals, council is looking at increasing the time limit for non-paid parking spaces in city lots to three hours instead of the current two-hour limit.\n\n\"Three hours would give people time to shop or do other business as well as to eat while they're downtown,\" Noland explained.\n\nMarietta Law Director Paul Bertram III said some council members have also recommended increasing the time limit to three hours for all current two-hour city parking spaces, whether they're located in parking lots or on the street.\n\nHe said that's one of the issues that has to be ironed out before legislation can be developed to create additional monthly rental spaces and to hire parking enforcement officers.\n\n\"The administration has to first put together a final parking lot plan, then a fund has to be set up in which to place the leased space monies and defining how those funds will be used,\" Bertram said.\n\nCouncil will then have to approve the fund and legislation before the additional spaces can be leased and revenue collected to pay for enforcement.\n\nBertram said making the changes by the first of the year is doable if council addresses those issues in the next couple of months. He noted the revenue and hiring of enforcement officers would also have to be addressed as council works on the 2014 municipal budget.\n\nHupp recently presented the council members with a draft job description for the part-time enforcement officers, which he estimated would cost the city about $15,000 each for their annual salaries.\n\nHe said the positions would be for 29 hours a week or less, and would require at least a high school diploma or equivalent. The officers would issue tickets for parking violations, be able to interact with the public and be able to prepare daily reports.\n\n\"The positions would likely come under supervision of the police department,\" Hupp said, adding that the enforcement officers would not only patrol parking lots, but also on-street parking and could monitor handicapped parking space violations in the Walmart complex.\n\nCity council eliminated the parking meters and enforcement officers in January 2007.\n\nIn 2006 the city's revenue from parking violation fines, monthly space rentals, and parking meters totaled $86,712. That year the city paid out a total $64,979 in salaries for a full-time parking enforcement officer and two part-time attendants at the Parking Partners lot.\n\nHupp said hiring two part-time parking enforcement officers under the plan currently being proposed would likely cost around $30,000 a year.\n\n\n\nI am looking for:\nNews, Blogs & Events Web"}
{"dataman_score": 4.0, "text": "Labor Stunner: Michigan Joins Ranks Of Right-To-Work States\n\nDecember 12, 2012\n\nThe Michigan legislature voted on December 11, 2012 to pass controversial right-to-work legislation affecting private and public sector employees throughout the historically union-friendly state.\u00a0 The legislation, which was signed almost immediately into law by Governor Rick Snyder, is a striking blow to Michigan\u2019s organized labor movement, particularly in the automotive industry.\u00a0 The new laws are expected to take effect as soon as April 2013.\u00a0\n\nWhat Does Right To Work Mean?\n\nUnder the National Labor Relations Act, employers and unions may agree to require all employees who are covered by a collective bargaining agreement to join the union or pay the equivalent in union dues after thirty days from initial employment, whether they want to or not.\u00a0 But under Section 14(b) of the NLRA, individual states may outlaw such agreements, and many have done so.\u00a0 In these \u201cright-to-work\u201d states, union membership is voluntary.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nOf course, even in states that have passed right-to-work legislation, unions can still represent employees and engage in collective bargaining, despite heated suggestions to the contrary by supporters of organized labor.\u00a0 Prior to Michigan, 23 states had enacted various forms of right-to-work legislation.\u00a0 Earlier this year, Indiana (another traditionally pro-labor Midwestern state) passed a right-to-work law.\u00a0\n\nWhy It\u2019s Important\n\nProponents of right-to-work laws argue that forced unionism is inherently unfair.\u00a0 In America, they contend, employees should not have to contribute to any cause that they do not personally agree with. \u00a0Add to that the fact that many, perhaps most, union members in Michigan have never had the opportunity to vote on whether they even wanted union representation.\u00a0 This is particularly true in the automotive industry where forced union membership has been the rule for more years than most of the members have lived.\u00a0\u00a0These employees never had the opportunity to vote on union membership or the payment of dues, so forced unionism can certainly be said to violate their freedom of association rights.\u00a0\n\nRight-to-work supporters also advance an equally persuasive economic argument.\u00a0 Analyzing various statistics, the National Institute for Labor Relations Research has drawn a strong correlation between right-to-work laws and ensuing economic growth.\u00a0 According to a recent study, private sector (non-farm) employment grew by 3.7% from 1999 to 2009 in right-to-work states, while shrinking 2.8% in the remaining states.\u00a0 During that 10-year period, real personal income rose 28.3% in right-to-work states, while dropping 14.7% elsewhere.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThese statistics plainly indicate that forced unionism states (i.e., states without right-to-work laws in place) are losing the economic development game.\u00a0 Consequently, it is not surprising that many of those states have been seriously considering right-to-work legislation to boost their troubled economies.\u00a0 But what is genuinely surprising is that states like Michigan, the birthplace of one of the largest unions in the country, the United Auto Workers, have joined in the movement.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nMichigan, like many other heavily-unionized states, has experienced abysmal economic growth in the last decade, as automakers and their suppliers have struggled to keep up with competitors who operate in more employer-friendly states and overseas.\u00a0 While the auto industry bailout of 2009 \u2013 one of the most polarizing topics of the most recent presidential election \u2013 has served as a band-aid to limit the economic bleeding of many Michigan companies, unemployment rates in the state continue at well above the national average.\u00a0\n\nThe Impact\n\nThe immediate impact of Michigan\u2019s new right-to-work laws is minimized somewhat by an important exception included in the legislation.\u00a0 As with the recent Indiana right-to-work law, the Michigan law applies only to agreements that take effect or are extended or renewed after the effective date\u00a0legislation in April of 2013.\u00a0 For future contracts, however, the impact will be substantial: public- and private-sector employees in the state will no longer have to pay union dues, or their equivalent, to hold certain jobs, and it will be unlawful for a collective bargaining agreement to include union-shop or mandatory dues check-off arrangements.\u00a0\n\nHow organized labor \u2013 and particularly the United Auto Workers\u00a0\u2013 will respond to this legislation remains to be seen, but a court challenge appears to already be in the works.\u00a0 In the meantime, the National Labor Relations Board continues to move full speed ahead with its decidedly pro-union agenda, routinely striking down employer policies that it construes as curtailing the rights of employees to engage in pro-union activities.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWith right-to-work legislation taking effect in one of the most historically labor-friendly states, and the inability of federal pro-labor bureaucrats to accomplish

Okay, we have to pry them off him at night he loves them so much.\n\nArtemis also has a bunch of adorable shorts, pants and t-shirts. What I\u2019ve found (and it makes my life easier) is that you can wear the individual items as a set or mix-and-match.\n\nSpeaking of uniforms, while The Kids won\u2019t be headed to school for a couple of years, it\u2019s still fun to look nice and you can never be too dressed up (if you ask me).\n\n\nIf you\u2019re in the market for some uniforms, check out just two of the great pairings that they have for boys and girls. What boy doesn\u2019t look handsome in a vest and tie? And their coats and shoes are absolutely adorable and comfortable (just ask my three year old).\n\nFYI, there\u2019s a Monster Sale going on right. Receive up to 70% off clearance items and 25% off school uniforms!\n\nThe Children\u2019s Place makes no secret about the fact that their products are Made in Bangladesh.

Hill\n\n    I like the boy outfit \u2013 I love dressing my little guy up to look a bit \u201cpreppy\u201d. I figure I might as well dress him in what I like on him while I can. It won\u2019t be long before he probably won\u2019t want to wear them ;)\n\n  20. Michelle Thompson\n\n    I adore both outfits and since i have both a son and a daughter , it makes it hard to choose one when i see them each looking great in those outfits! winning this with school coming would be such a huge help!\n\n\nLeave a Reply\n\n\n\nCommentLuv badge\n\nSubscribe to Journeys of the Zoo! \u21d2"}

{"dataman_score": 4.0, "text": "\"What if?\"\n\nThat is the question the state wants North Lebanon Township to answer in preparation for a potential breach at the Ebenezer Lake dam.\n\nSteve Sherk of Steckbeck Engineering & Surveying told the supervisors Monday night his firm turned in a report about the dam in 2012. Then, in April this year, the state notified the township it was requiring an engineering study and an incremental breach analysis on the dam.\n\nSherk explained that the analysis involves a model of a 500-year and 1,000-year flood in a nonbreach scenario and in a breach scenario. These models would answer the question: \"What would happen if a 500-year (or 1,000-year) flood occurred?\" Those results would then be compared to an ideal situation.\n\nThe ultimate goal, he said, is the safety for those downstream from the dam.\n\n\"If the state finds a deficiency in capacity, they may want you to develop a plan to address that deficiency,\" he said.\n\nThe dam is rated \"C1,\" Sherk said. The letter designates the size of the dam, and the number represents a high-hazard dam - meaning there is potential for loss of life along with damage to homes and structures in the event of a breach.\n\nSherk proposed an $8,000 agreement in which his firm would provide a topographical map, limited field survey, multiple meetings with state officials and an incremental breach analysis.\n\nThe supervisors balked at the total, noting they would like to postpone action until after preliminary work is done on the 2014 budget.\n\n\nAfter discussion, they agreed to begin the process with preliminary work at a cost of $2,000.\n\nIn unrelated business, Sherk presented information about the Lebanon County Clean Water Alliance, a group of nearly two dozen municipalities working together to share ideas on stormwater management and the Chesapeake Bay pollution reduction implementation plan.\n\nThe group has secured a grant for a study outlining how to proceed. The goal, he said, is for municipalities to share ideas and costs in a cost-effective manner.\n\nSherk said he was not asking the supervisors to commit to involvement, only that they review the materials provided by the alliance.\n\nIn addition, Sherk presented a proposal for engineering work to design a new baseball field to replace one that will be eliminated with the expansion of the township's recycling center. In addition to the replacement field, the township had asked Sherk to present ideas on additional parking and ways to alleviate drainage problems.\n\nAt a cost of $14,000, Sherk proposed providing a site plan, drainage plan, grading plan, stormwater management plan and documents. For an additional $4,500, his firm would prepare bid documents and administer the project.\n\nThe supervisors authorized the initial planning stages of the project."}

Roswell\n\nJohn A. Schwarz was born in New York in the late 1850\u2032s to German immigrants. He began as a clerk in a furniture store. In 1876 He opened his first store in Brooklyn, at the 838-40 Broadway address on the ad. When he started out he only had a 20 foot space in the 838 building, but business grew until he took over the entire building and the building next store. So the 838-40 address refers to building numbers 838 and 840 Broadway.\n\nJohn died in 1906 and the business was taken over by his sons, John Jr. Edward and Frank.\n\nIn 1910 they opened another location at 1321 and later 1319 Broadway.\n\nThe 334 Livingston Street store was opened in 1922 and the 16601 Jamaica Avenue store around 1925, so one can guess the ad was painted in or around 1925. (since another store was opened in 1926 at 1535 Broadway, which took over Phelan\u2019s Furniture Company.\n\nAccording to a 1921 ad from the Broklyn Daily Eagle, John was quite a friendly guy, and when his first store opened people were more than happy to buy furniture from him, which was instrumental in growth of the business. \u2013 Caroline D.

I was very impressed with the quality of the hair. I have washed it and I love the natural wave of the straight hair. The wavy hair and the curly hair are very pretty as well. I love it. I would have loved to see the weft to see the construction of it and to see the length of the beards. I have no complaints though. I cannot wait to get my money together so I can place an order. The color is a beautiful natural black/brown and when flat ironed the hair is smooth and beautiful. I love the fact that with Perfectlocks, you can order the hair and the closures from the same place, ensuring that all of your hair are of the same type, color and quality. I just love it.\nDate Added: 04/09/2013\u00a0by Sherry Lewis"}

With invaluable solidarity from people like you, the East Timorese resistance prevailed in a victory of David and Goliath proportions.\n\n\nFor years, Washington insiders said it could never happen, as administration after administration actively assisted the Indonesian occupation of East Timor. I think you'll agree with me that the East Timor Action Network (ETAN) not only proved that independence for East Timor was possible but helped make it happen. ETAN harnessed the power of ordinary people in the United States people like you and me to redirect the policy of the most powerful government in the world. I can't think of a better recent example of grassroots action changing U.S. foreign policy.\n\n\nBut independence does not guarantee freedom, and ETAN's work has not ended. Justice for East Timor has been denied, and global powers threaten East Timor's sovereignty. Human rights conditions have worsened in Indonesia, where military tactics honed in East Timor are now being used in the provinces of Aceh and Papua. Yet the Bush administration continues to mount an aggressive campaign to make sure that Congress continues to expand its \"re-engagement\" with the Indonesian military.\n\n\nETAN needs your support to tackle these challenges. That is why I am writing to you in this season of giving to ask for your generous contribution to the East Timor Action Network. [http://www.etan.org/etan/2002appl.htm online]\n\n\nEast Timor's horizons, though free of military occupation, are dimmed by widespread poverty resulting from a quarter-century of occupation and centuries of colonial exploitation and neglect. It is the poorest country in Asia. International financial institutions intimately involved in virtually every facet of life in East Timor the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, the International Monetary Fund cast long shadows on the new democracy and its aspirations for self-reliance.\n\n\nBut East Timor is coming of age in an era of globalized movements for social justice. The painful experiences of poor nations subject to IMF/World Bank-imposed restrictions on social spending have shown that such policies only deepen inequities. Grassroots activists now have an opportunity to work with the people of East Timor before \"structural adjustment\" and a vicious debt trap ravage the nation.\n\n\nWith partners in East Timor, ETAN has already taken preemptive action. Last spring, ETAN launched an international grassroots campaign for a debt-free and structural-adjustment-free East Timor. East Timor has won for now, the new government's \"no-loans\" policy survived. But this is only the beginning of a formidable fight.\n\n\nFor decades, the U.S. government stood in the way of self-determination for the East Timorese people. Bypassing democracy and ignoring human suffering, successive U.S. administrations supplied the Indonesian dictatorship with lethal military training and millions upon millions of dollars worth of weaponry.\n\n\nWith your help, ETAN has worked tirelessly for more than a decade first to win and then to maintain restrictions on U.S. assistance for Indonesia's military. In today's political climate of \"war on terror,\" these restrictions are under serious threat. We now face our toughest challenge in years. Some military training may be restored in 2003. With all the resources the Pentagon has at its disposal, this fight will not be won easily. But it can be won. Thanks to ETAN's hard work, the U.S. government won't be arming the Indonesian military next year.\n\n\nIn August, Indonesia's ad hoc Human Rights Court on East Timor acquitted six Indonesian military and police officers of crimes against humanity committed in East Timor in 1999. The court's failure to bring those officers to justice reinforced ETAN's long-standing call for an international tribunal on East Timor. But what was the State Department's response to this grave injustice? That the trials will serve as a \"warning [to] those who might consider new violations of human rights in Aceh and elsewhere.\"\n\n\nIt is because of Bush administration stances like this that ETAN needs your support.\n\n\nSince 1991, ETAN has made sure that the human rights of the East Timorese and Indonesian people are not ignored by U.S. policymakers.\n\n\nThroughout this past year, ETAN's pressure for an international tribunal, a ban on military assistance for Indonesia and East Timor's right to economic self-determination has generated countless phone calls and letters to elected representatives and corresponding congressional action. ETAN's extensive spring speaking tour with an East Timorese women's and human rights activist built awareness, developed new grassroots contacts and increased support for congressional resolutions calling for a tribunal.\n\n\nMore pressure is needed in 2003.\n\n\nI encourage you to take a look at the ETAN's Annual Report (http://www.etan.org/etan/2002anul.htm). The accomplishments of the East Timor Action Network speak for themselves, as does the organization's modest budget. ETAN has truly done so much with so little.\n\n\nIn the current atmosphere of \"us against them\" warmongering, ETAN is an important example of what a dedicated group of activists can do to move our country in a more sane direction. Your financial support is needed to continue their work. Please think about ETAN and make as generous a donation as possible.\n\n\nThank you for you generous support. And best wishes of peace and health this holiday season.\n\n\n\n\nHoward Zinn Historian Author, A People's History of the United States\n\n\nClick here to make a tax-deductible donatation online http://www.etan.org/etan/2002appl.htm online or send your check to ETAN/US 1202 Williamson St Madison, WI 53703\n\n\n*Donations of any size for ETAN's political and advocacy work should be made out to ETAN and are not tax-deductible. Tax-deductible checks for over $50 can be made out to \"The Foundation for International Scientific Cooperation/ETAN\" and will be used to support our educational work."}

I have resided at the shelter since 2-8-2011 in the B building. During my time I found that there were many issues regarding \"helping\" the women staying there.\n\nFirst, there is no proactive assessment done to see what the victim needs upon arrival (food, clothing etc.) Also, many of us have food stamp cases or PA cases and the abuser is the one with the ebt card and head of household status on the cases. If we are placed with P.A.T.H we go to N.O.V.A, which gets us placement at various shelters. This letter, along with the letter from the shelter we are in, can get our cases transferred to our names and make life easier. What I found is a huge disconnect within the case managers getting these letters to the women timely. This puts the woman's ability to even buy food for their children at a quick stop. As they do not have the ebt card to use, usually the abuser does. Also, having to wait in the wait area for case managers with kids that are hungry and in need of sleep and food for more then 2 hours at times. I found completely unacceptable! why do the children and women have to suffer further at the shelter they are placed at to help them?\n\nI, myself, when I came there had just left a police precinct. We had only the clothes on our backs- no food and no belongings. The shelter gave me a mere 35 dollar voucher for 5 people and no advice as how to go about getting things done. My abuser is very tricky. I always had to be a step ahead of him or I would get plundered by him. He robbed me controlled everything and was always checking on what I was doing. This is what batterers do as you know!\n\nSo if that is the case, why doesn't the shelter have in place a way to help, really help, the women with their issues and getting back control and quickly! Everything going on is time sensitive the victim has to be quick and the case workers are fundamental to that process. I was never given any letters advocating early on when me and my kids needed clothes food. I asked, but usually was told to wait and when you have 3 young kids hungry and a staff that thinks that its appropriate to have your hungry children wait over an hour to be seen. I just don't see how this is helping the women. Many, many women return to the batterer because of the way the shelters treat them and do really nothing to help them. This is a tragedy! Who is to blame?\n\nThis brings me to the current issue I am dealing with at the shelter. May I just say I had a room mate XXXXXXX who was thrown out by the shelter on lies-she had no place to go no money nothing but was none the less made to leave at night. Her kids had school the next day and now her and her kids are on the street with nothing!\n\nI now have an apartment my ACS caseworker has ordered me beds and I want to move out. However the shelter staff advised me that they would be calling ACS on me if I did? But not only that, I was lied to by XXXXXX and XXXXXX, they told me that I would lose my kids and that it was an ACS mandate that I have beds and a table to move. However, I did speak to ACS and they said there is no such mandate and that they have no problem with me moving to my apartment and sleeping on air mattresses with my kids. But the caseworker Beverly insisted that she would call ACS on me if I left? She even spoke with the ACS worker who said that she knew i had no beds and that she, in fact, had ordered them for me and that there was nothing in any law book or ACS mandate that says I have to have beds. Yet your agency still insists to call ACS on me if I leave.\n\nI spoke to Mrs. XXXX, who stated that she \"would do what she has to do\" and that I should do what I have to do. Is this how your agency functions? One instant you throw women out who have nothing based on lies. The next you impede another woman who just wants to move forward with her life? I feel this is a gross misjudgement on the director and case managers part also not to mention that the director Mrs. XXXX said she would get me her supervisor but actually hung up the phone on me. I have been living a nightmare for the past 8 years. I thought going to a DV shelter would be a new horizon. But instead I was faced with another cold reality- no one cares and, I still have to fight for what me and my children need. Why? Because the DV shelters lack the human element of empathy and compassion, two forces that are critical to the function of us as a society and to the recovery of battered women.\n\nJulie Kaous\nPost a comment\nWrite a comment:\n\nRelated Searches"}

Lesli Kay has served As the World Turns with the utmost professionalism and enthusiasm for the past seven years. We wish her and her family nothing but the best.\"\n\nIn recent published reports, it had been hinted that General Hospital had all but given up on finding an actress to play Lois. According to insiders, the show had auditioned several former soap for the role, including Lisa LoCicero (ex-Jocelyn, The City/Loving) and Alicia Coppola (ex-Lorna, Another World). However, for one reason or another, none of the actresses who tried out for the part were quite right for the role.\n\nSome fans were vocal when it was revealed that Rena Sofer had not been asked to reprise the role of Lois. Sofer originated the role in 1994 and remained with the show through 1997. However, Sofer revealed that despite statements of interest from co-head writer Charles Pratt, Jr., she had not been asked to return to the show.\n\nKay joined the cast of As the World Turns in May 1997. In 2001, Kay earned a Daytime Emmy for Outstanding Supporting Actress. Though the CBS soap is Kay's only television experience in a starring role, the actress does have extensive movie and theater experience under her belt.\n\nA final airdate for Kay on As the World Turns comes July 2nd. Meanwhile, an ABC spokesperson reveals that Kay will debut on General Hospital on June 10.\n\nIn related news, Adrianne Leon has been cast in the role of Lynn (a.k.a Brooklyn), the daughter of Ned and Lois. June 1st is her first airdate.\n\nPhoto Credit: ABC\n\nRELATED STORYLois to return to GH -- but Rena Sofer won't.\nShare this story with friends, family or the world.\n\nPRINTABLE VERSION View a printer friendly version of this article\n\nRelated Information\nMaking headlines on"}

Several sources tell me and my colleague Chris Frates that insurance executives are being told to keep quiet,\" said Griffin, adding, \"Sources (are) telling us they fear White House retribution.\"\n\nThe fact that the White House is threatening private companies with undisclosed forms of \"retribution\" if they criticize government policy is a shocking display of authoritarianism that wouldn't look out of place in countries like Communist China or Stalinist North Korea.\n\n\n\n\nGriffin also suggested that insurance companies were adhering to the White House gag order because, \"It is the federal government that's the biggest customer for these insurance companies.\"\n\nWhite House spokesman Jay Carney labeled the accusations \"preposterous and inaccurate,\" which is similar to how the administration reacted when it was accused of having foreknowledge of the fact that millions of Americans would lose their healthcare coverage due to Obamacare. It subsequently emerged that White House officials knew this would be the case at least three years in advance.\n\n\nFacebook @ https://www.facebook.com/paul.j.watson.71\nFOLLOW Paul Joseph Watson @ https://twitter.com/PrisonPlanet\n\n\n\n\n\nWeb PM"}
{"dataman_score": 4.0, "text": "A Time to Defend Labor and the Public Sector\n\nThanks to the leadership that workers in Wisconsin and other states took in the Spring of 2011, Americans seized the opportunity to change the debate about the fiscal crisis in the states, its origins, and the way it was being used to attack the labor movement and to dismantle public services.\n\nRegions: California Iowa Nebraska North Carolina Ohio Wisconsin\n\nIn many states LAWCHA members are already playing a role in these discussions. Will Jones and Steve Meyer have been in the news about Wisconsin. In North Carolina, LAWCHA members have pulled together faculty from numerous colleges and universities in a group called North Carolina Protecting the Public Interest to stand with these workers and those who need their services. We urge LAWCHA members to do more to bring our perspectives as labor historians to bear on this crisis.\n\n\n\nIowa unions have been spurred to action this week both in solidarity with neighboring Wisconsin workers and in opposition to attacks from Iowa lawmakers. Despite growing resistance to assaults on public employee rights in other Midwestern states, last Friday Iowa House Republicans introduced HSB 117, their own assault on Iowa\u2019s 37-year-old public bargaining law. Iowa union members, allies, and elected officials have since mounted strong and growing opposition.\n\nIowa\u2019s Public Employment Relations Act was signed into law by a Republican governor in 1974. Its passage was presaged by the adoption of similar laws in neighboring states as well as growing pressure from strikes waged by Iowa teachers and firefighters. By all accounts, the system has worked well to promote negotiated settlements of public sector contracts; 98% of public sector contracts in Iowa are settled voluntarily. Those that reach impasse are forwarded to a third-party arbitrator, whose decision is final and binding.\n\nRepublicans have pitched their \u201creform\u201d of Iowa\u2019s public bargaining law to the media as a budgetary solution to rising health care costs. The bill would further limit the scope of negotiations, prohibiting bargaining over health insurance, outsourcing, and other items, and would require all public employees to pay at least 30% of the cost of their health insurance.\n\nBut as in Wisconsin and other states, the bill\u2019s most significant proposals are aimed at stripping fundamental union rights, weakening worker bargaining power, and undermining the purpose of collective bargaining. The bill would, for example, allow either the governor or legislature to reject an arbitrator\u2019s decision on state contracts, essentially making collective bargaining meaningless for state employees. Indeed, the provision appears to be an attempt to reverse a 1991 Iowa Supreme Court ruling issued against current Governor Terry Branstad when, during his previous tenure as governor, he attempted to veto pay increases awarded to state employees via the legally binding arbitration process.\n\nAnother provision of the bill would allow any public employee to declare him or herself a \u201cfree agent,\u201d rejecting union representation and coverage under an existing collective bargaining agreement. This proposal strikes at the heart of the principle of \u201cexclusive representation,\u201d the foundational legal obligation of an employer to deal with a single, democratically selected union as the bargaining agent for all employees in a given unit. Such a provision could allow employers to offer special deals to individuals who opt out of bargaining unit coverage as a means of weakening bargaining power encouraging decertification elections (after which, complete control of workplace terms and conditions would return to management\u2019s hands).\n\nIn response, over 2,000 Iowa union members and supporters rallied at the state capitol on February 22 in solidarity with public sector workers in Iowa, Wisconsin, and across the globe. Additional rallies have taken place since in multiple locations around the state, and a second statehouse rally is scheduled for Saturday in Des Moines.\n\nIowa Democrats have also appeared buoyed by worker protests. In their own show of solidarity, last night minority House Democrats kept a Labor Committee discussion of HSB 117 alive for over 15 hours straight, offering 48 amendments and continuous objection to the bill\u2019s attack on bargaining rights. As Rep. Bruce Hunter put it, \u201cYou\u2019re attacking the workers of the state of Iowa, and when you attack the workers of Iowa, we are going to fight for them.\u201d Early this morning, the bill passed out of committee on a party-line vote, but Senate leader Mike Gronstal (who rallied with workers earlier in the week) has already pledged to prevent the bill from coming to the floor in the senate, where Democrats hold a slim majority.\n\nHundreds of Iowans have made trips to Madison during the past two weeks to join protests there, and union-sponsored buses continue to travel back and forth from eastern Iowa daily. Along with raising their voices, Iowa union members have taken shifts sleeping on the capitol floor, helped direct shuttle bus parking, and transported food donations. Many have returned from Madison transformed and ready to take action of their own. As one of them put it, solidarity is \u201cspreading like fire on the prairie.\u201d\n\nSubmitted by Jennifer Sherer, Director, University of Iowa Labor Center.\n\n\nNebraska is right in the mix of all this anti-union stuff with 8 measures either to restrict public sector bargaining or eliminate it altogether.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nA group of LAWCHA members from the Research Triangle Area in November founded North Carolina Protecting the Public Interest, a network of scholars (faculty and graduate students) from colleges and universities throughout the state who have come together to oppose the proposed devastating cuts to public school and service budgets and provide a research center and speakers bureau on these issues for organizations and media. We have almost 100 signatories from over a dozen institutions and, prompted by the struggle in Wisconsin, are now providing news feeds to media and organizations with short lists of our expertise (list in formation attached, as an example for those who would like to start similar efforts elsewhere).\n\nPlease visit our website, a template that could easily be copied and modified for other states: http://lawcha.org/ncprotectingthepublic.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to organize a group like this if you have even 2-3 people who can then reach out to contacts elsewhere via email and calls to get it going. Time is of the essence, what with Wisconsin legislators getting ready to vote and the recent Conservative Political Action Conference aggressively promoting similar attacks on public services and workers across the country.\n\nFor more information or to send resources or news for our site, please contact ncptpi@gmail.com or Nancy MacLean at nancy.maclean@duke.edu or (919) 937-9409.\n\n\nThings are also heating in Ohio over collective bargaining for public employees.\n\n\nThe most dramatic events, of course, have been occurring in Wisconsin.

This is one of the foundational premises of preferred-provider and agency-of-record relationships. Unfortunately, this premise has a fatal flaw. And it is the root of the identity crisis confronting our industry.\n\nThe reality is, rather than providing true partners, more often than not, suppliers, squeezed for profitability, are forced to assign their less expensive and usually less experienced staff. The results frequently leave clients wanting, but powerless to change the situation. So, while the client company saves money, they may miss out on a creative and informed view of their customer that could mean the difference between success and failure for a product.\n\nTo me, this is a sad state of affairs. We are literally burning furniture to create heat. Here's what one client's marketing group does instead. It still operates within the world of procurement, but provides an opportunity for much better results. They invite many companies along with incumbents to a meeting where the client presents the current situation and goals. Then, all invitees are invited to submit proposals outlining how they can help and the client is free to decide on the merits of the approach.\n\nRealistically, the incumbent should always be in a stronger position to win, but the process gives the client an alternative. And newer companies get the opportunity to bid in a situation that they wouldn't otherwise. It's a win-win-win. The process achieves the same financial result, provides a means to a superior outcome, and keeps all the suppliers on their toes.\n\n"}

They were not, however, expecting an altercation with University of Oregon faculty member James Olmsted.\n\n\u201cWe were prepared for having people who were not going to agree with us,\u201d Salgado said. \u201cWe never expected anyone to come up to the group and be so blatantly racist.\u201d\n\nOlmsted, an adjunct instructor in the UO Law School, was detained by the University of Oregon Police, cited for second-degree theft, two counts of physical harassment and barred indefinitely from campus. Olmsted\u2019s alleged actions took place during the student group\u2019s mock border checkpoint, a political theater demonstration meant to bring awareness to human rights issues of immigrants crossing the U.S.-Mexico border and of Palestinians in the Israel-Palestine conflict.\n\nOn Friday, the university announced that Olmsted\u2019s teaching duties had been reassigned to Adell Amos, the law school\u2019s associate dean for academic affairs. Olmsted\u2019s name was also removed from the adjunct faculty website.\n\nUO spokesperson Phil Weiler said the University cannot comment on personnel matters and that the law school is handling the issue.\n\n\u201c(The law school) is taking the appropriate steps,\u201d Weiler said.\n\nBy that morning, videos of Olmsted cursing at and pushing students were spreading through campus after going viral Thursday night. UO law students and faculty received an email from Phillip H. Knight Dean of Law Michael Moffitt the next day addressing the issue.\n\n\u201cWe are aware that Mr. Olmsted was involved in an incident with students on the afternoon of Thursday, March 14,\u201d Moffitt wrote. \u201cAs dean, I expect all members of the University of Oregon School of Law community to conduct themselves with the highest degree of professionalism and respect for public discourse, especially with those with whom they may disagree.\u201d\n\nAccording to Salazar, Olmsted did not seem aggressive at first and the group engaged him in political discussion.\n\n\u201cAt first he didn\u2019t come off as aggressive \u2026 he was just trying to find out what we were (demonstrating),\u201d Salazar said.\n\nStudents began recording when the situation escalated. According to Salazar, Olmsted began making radical racist statements, saying he wanted to nuke the Middle East and telling students to start a war if they wanted change.\n\n\u201cIf you want this country back, start a fucking war and take it back,\u201d Olmsted said in a seven-minute video Salgado posted to YouTube. \u201cInstead of being pussies, do something.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is what we\u2019re doing,\u201d a student protested.\n\nOlmsted\u2019s tone calmed.\n\n\u201cThis is why I stopped,\u201d he said. \u201cI am proud of you for that.\u201d\n\nAccording to Olmsted\u2019s attorney, Mike Arnold, there is information missing from the story despite recordings from multiple vantage points.\n\n\u201cEven with the ability to record parts of a situation with audio and video, you\u2019re still going to have huge gaps in a story,\u201d he said.\n\nAdditionally, the video recordings bring up legal matters of whether students had the right to record Olmsted, Arnold said. Under Oregon law, the subjects of audio recording one must be notified if he or she is being recorded. However, an exception has been made for recording with an unconcealed device in public places during an event. Arnold said that it is uncertain under Oregon law whether a cell phone qualifies as an unconcealed recording device.\n\n\u201cThe recording of him that was seized is possibly an illegal recording,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cIt could be argued as legal or illegal.\u201d\n\nHowever, UO communications law professor Kyu Ho Youm believes there was little ground to claim a specific violation of the law, especially since the use of the recordings is not commercial.\n\n\u201cWhatever he was doing at the EMU amphitheater was in a public place and everybody and anybody could see it,\u201d Youm said.\n\nRegardless of the recording\u2019s legality, Arnold said that without Olmsted\u2019s input, any account of it is one-sided.\n\n\u201cBy virtue of this being taken into legal context, it makes it impossible for Mr. Olmsted or anyone involved with him to comment on the facts, which by virtue will make the reporting of the facts one-sided,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cIt\u2019s just the way it is.\u201d\n\nUO student Andrew Seng said he believed Olmsted was trying to play the devil\u2019s advocate with the student group to engage its members in political debate.\n\n\u201cA lot of times when people are doing a demonstration \u2026 they don\u2019t really know their facts, so a lot of people try to challenge them. I thought that\u2019s what he was doing,\u201d Seng said. \u201cHe was saying some pretty radical things so I don\u2019t know why any normal person would say those things.\u201d\n\nSeng said he doesn\u2019t know whether Olmsted believed what he was saying or trying to spark debate.\n\n\u201cIn either case, he took it too far,\u201d Seng said.\n\nDespite Olmsted\u2019s claim that he was part of the demonstration, Salazar said she was intimidated when he dropped the motorcycle helmet he was carrying to the ground, removed his jacket and came toward her.\n\n\u201cThis is an aggressive tone,\u201d Salazar said during the confrontation. \u201cI am feeling pretty threatened right now.\u201d\n\nWhen an unidentified man, who Salazar and Salgado said was not part of Students Against Imperialism, stepped forward to intervene and placed his hand on Olmsted, the now-former law instructor pushed back.\n\nOlmsted threw his glasses to the ground, and pushed Salazar out of the way when trying to reach for them. He then noticed Salgado recording the incident on her cell phone and seized it, claiming she had no right to record him. Shortly afterwards, two UOPD officers arrived on the scene and detained Olmsted.\n\nSince the videos have been uploaded, Salazar said support has poured in from students, faculty and staff, as well as international news sources such as the Electronic Intifada, which covered the incident.\n\nThere has also been backlash. Salazar said students have been accused of provoking Olmsted.\n\nSeng witnessed the incident and said that this is not the case.\n\n\u201cI was sort of waiting around for 3o minutes \u2026 and all the sudden this guy came out of nowhere,\u201d Seng said. \u201cA lot of people are wondering if he was provoked but he wasn\u2019t provoked at all.\u201d\n\n  \u2022 Misanthrope\n\n    Regardless of whether he was provoked, it\u2019s never okay to lay your hands on another person without their consent.\n\n    \u2022 CATE\n\n      That is right. The students started it by putting their hands on Olmsted and he pushed the guy away who was standing right up in his face with his hands on him. The students started the fight and he had a right to defend himself.\n\n      \u2022 Jose\n\n        Go home CATE Your Drunk as Olmsted\n\n      \u2022 john smith\n\n        I\u2019m going to give you the benefit of the doubt here for the reason that you may not have seen this specific video of the incident\u2026\n\n        As you can clearly see at the 1:00 mark,Olmsted gets right in the face of the smaller student and says \u201cMy country,f\u2014ing move me.\u201dHe then,in a very threatening manner,takes off his jacket as though he\u2019s preparing to fight them and repeats,\u201dmove me\u201d.Only then does the male student(who\u2019s not even part of the demonstration,incidentally)get in between Olmsted and the female student in an attempt to diffuse the situation.While it\u2019s true that the male student then put his hand on Olmsted\u2019s arm(something he should not have done),once Olmsted forcefully pushes the male student away neither he nor anyone else puts their hands on Olmsted again.Meanwhile,Olmsted then pushes another female student out of the way in order to get the glasses that he threw on the ground himself.The fact that the male student put his hand on Olmsted in no way gives Olmsted the right to push the female student,who had done nothing to him.Olmsted is the clear aggressor in this situation,if you can\u2019t see that you\u2019re blind.\n\n      \u2022 Christopher Swing\n\n        Olmsted was clearly the aggressor here. Someone touching him in an attempt to prevent him from assaulting someone else isn\u2019t an excuse for him to commit theft.\n\n  \u2022 CATE\n\n    I just read an article in the Emerald where they were making crazy claims calling him a racist and so on. Seriously, he is a liberal environmental law professor. I was a student at the law school and knew Olmsted 20 years ago.\n\n    From my viewing of the video, he was clearly playing devils advocate and trying to engage them in friendly but heated debate. They mistook his actions when he took off his jacket by exaggerating what he was doing because they did not understand he was trying to engage them\u2026. I don\u2019t get the impression those kids had the experience or background to be in a debate based on their mis-infomrtion in the school paper. They lose credibility when they make statements such as the US is planing to deport all illegal aliens. But I still don\u2019t get why he bothered\u2026.except now I read they were having a mock border check, asking people for ID and that may mean they were not letting him pass. One student put his hands on him and got in his face, and Olmsted reacted by pushing him away from him. I would have done the same thing if someone was aggressive like that. He was within his rights to defend himself to move the guy out of an area where the guy could have done bodily harm. Also, he clearly did not mean to steal the cell phone\u2026that is stupid and poor judgment of the police. I was under the impression it was against the law to tape someone without their permission\u2026it is at least a gray area. When he asked them to stop filming, and they didn\u2019t, then they went over the line. Maybe as a faculty member, he felt he was within his rights to take the phone.\n\n    if these kids have any decency, they should fess up and ask the campus to drop the charges and Olmsted should get his job back. These kids would gain credibility and trust for their cause if they acted with integrity and not ruin a man\u2019s life for sport. They have a message behind their cause that is worth hearing, but they deliver it with such exageration, and with such ill will toward someone like Olmsted, the message is lost.\n\n    Olmsted didn\u2019t use the best judgment, but then we still don\u2019t have all the facts. What we do know is this group has a penchant for gross exaggerations and accusations based on the article they printed about their group in the school paper.\n\n    Also, shame on the dean of the law school for over reacting, without giving Olmsted any due process or even talking to him. Considering this is a law school where the professor worked, it is shocking there was no due process. They seem to be quite afraid of these students and eager to please. That is just embarrassing for the law school. Where are the adults and the level heads in all of this?\n\n    \u2022 Lightoening\n\n      For someone who states that \u201cwe still don\u2019t have all the facts\u201d you sure do throw out your opinions as if they were facts. Is that you hiding behind an alias, Professor Olmsted?\n\n    \u2022 Christopher Swing\n\n      We have enough facts to know that he committed at least two crimes.\n\n    \u2022 ehomer\n\n      If you were, in fact, a \u201cstudent at the law school\u201d, which I doubt, you must not have gotten past L1.\n\n  \u2022 CATE\n\n    Per my comments below, if Olmsted was arrested on a charge of harassment, then the kid who put his hands on him and got in his face in a physically threatening stance should be too based on that line of reasoning. The kid should be at a minimum, kicked off the campus for the same number of months. Olmsted from what I could see was acting as a teacher the whole time, telling them not to film him, taking the camera away from a disobeying student, and dealing with an unruly crowd that (I don\u2019t know this for sure other than the article says that there was a mock border crossing) had blocked him from passing. He also appeared to be playing devils advocate to show them how outrageous their comments were. I have seen plenty of male teachers in my day tussle with students who were trying to start a fight like that kid and none of them lost their job over it. If you view it from that perspective, the students should be in trouble not Olmsted.\n\n    \u2022 Judge Judy\n\n      \u201d I was a student at the law school and knew Olmsted 20 years ago.\u201d\n\n      Cate \u2013 \u201cif Olmsted was arrested on a charge of harassment, then the kid who put\n      should be too\u2026\u201d\n\n      Dude, with perceptual skills like that, how did you even get out of high school, let alone into Law School??\n\n      Cate \u2013 \u201cOlmsted from what I could see was acting as a teacher the whole time,\u201d\n\n      Oh, really?? The Teacher: \u201cIf you want this country back, start a fucking war and take it back, Instead\n      of being pussies, do something.\u201d And what class might this be, Fuckology 404??\n\n      Cate \u2014 \u201ctaking the camera away from a disobeying student\u2019\n\n      Cate. You entirely miss the point that the student, nor any other citizen, was under any obligation to obey your \u201cliberal\u2019 professor. Thank you for once again proving the point that there is no correlation between higher academic credentials and common sense.\n\n    \u2022 Christopher Swing\n\n      These aren\u2019t children in a classroom. They\u2019re adults with rights. Olmsted had no business engaging in theft and harassment, and no special powers as a \u201cteacher.\u201d\n\n      If you actually had any clue about the law, you\u2019d understand how nonsensical a comment you\u2019ve just written.\n\n    \u2022 Nemo\n\n      You mean the guy who was was speaking calmly and stepped between Olmsted and the girl whose cell phone he was arrested for stealing? The guy who we hear trying to diffuse the situation? He was the one who was \u201ctrying to start a fight\u201d? You sound like a lawyer who\u2019s used to defending guilty clients.\n\n      Olmsted may be a perfectly nice guy. Whether he is or not, he had a right to say whatever he wanted. But that\u2019s not what got him arrested.\n\n  \u2022 shorelineliz\n\n    It seems to me that Professor Olmsted was engaging the students in a disagreement and when this young man put his hand on his shoulder then it was the young man who started the physical stuff. And if Professor Olmsted doesn\u2019t want to be recorded on a cell phone he has a right to tell Jackie Selgado to not record him. It seems to me Ms. Selgado was infringing on the Professors \u201cprivacy rights\u201d when she recorded him. If Selgado and others want to demonstrate on campus they can but others can disagree. and vehemently. But once someone puts their hands on someone FIRST then it is a whole nuther ball of wax and once you start \u201crecording\u201d people you invade their \u201cprivacy.\u201d Ms. Selgado needs a lesson in constitutional law. Who is the Law professor and who is the student? I thought so.\n\n    \u2022 Christopher Swing\n\n      He had a right to ask to not be recorded\u2026 and anyone recording has the right to ignore the request.\n\n      You can\u2019t infringe on someone\u2019s \u201cprivacy rights\u201d in a public place. They don\u2019t exist there. That\u2019s why it\u2019s called a *public place.*\n\n      You really need to get a clue as to how things really work.\n\n  \u2022 Anon\n\n    The spin on this comments section makes Fox News look like a bastion of Truth and Journalism.\n\n    Sorry but it is Not against the law to film someone in public\u2026especially not when they are screaming and being threatening\u2026\n\n    Throwing down his jacket was clearly as signal he was ready for a physical confrontation as also communicated by his vocal level and hostile yelling. The guy was being a jerk and deserves to be run out of town.\n\n    Anyone who can look at the video and see anything different is suffering from denial\u2026if it had been the student protestors acting like Mr. Olmsted\u2026these same voices.. Cate/shorelineliz \u2026 would have been calling for their arrest and expulsion. Civil debate was not what Olmsted was trying to do. He was trying to start a fight.\n\n  \u2022 Paid-for-hire Mouthpiece 101\n\n    \u201c\u201cEven with the ability to record parts of a situation with audio and\n    video, you\u2019re still going to have huge gaps in a story,\u201d said the attorney.\u201d\n\n    And that story will surely be told, even if it\u2019s a work of semi-fiction.\n\n  \u2022 Paid-for-hire Mouthpiece 101\n\n    \u201d Arnold said that it is uncertain under Oregon law whether a cell phone qualifies as an unconcealed recording device.\u201d\n\n    What a totally, idiotic statement that is in this day and age.\n\n  \u2022 NorthCascadian\n\n    \u201cDespite Olmsted\u2019s claim that he was part of the demonstration,\u2026\u201d This frankly seems the most plausible. Why would he hang around, why didn\u2019t the students walk away from him and start talking with others? A half an hour of put-ons seems forced. Taking off his jacket and throwing down his helmet seems dramatic. Now the Huffington post has picked it up. What about Rachael Corrie? What about justice for Palestine? Nothing to talk about there now that we have this bizarre event. I want more witness testimony.\n\n  \u2022 Lewis Clements Sr.\n\n    To me it looks like he is part of the group playing a part of outraged citizen.\n\n  \u2022 Ashley\n\n    I despise people who \u201cplay devil\u2019s advocate.\u201d All you\u2019re doing is being an asshole, and treating issues that deeply affect the lives of others as a game. You\u2019re not bring up any new information, any new ideas, any new opinions. Playing devil\u2019s advocate is being able to spew the same shitty status-quo under the guise of philosophical discussion. If you don\u2019t really believe it, don\u2019t fucking say it. You are helping no one.\n\n  \u2022 Ihaveseentherealterrorists\n\n    The SAI forgot to dress some of their members as mock homicide bombers. Perhaps they could have been both homicide bombers and mentally and or physically disabled to add realism.\n\n  \u2022 Ihaveseentherealterrorists\n\n    The professor had no more nor no less rights to do what he did than the students. The students did not recognize the professors exercise of his rights. This is not a classroom. If you can\u2019t handle the fire, get out of the kitchen.\n\n    \u2022 Christopher Swing\n\n      He had no right to commit theft.\n\n  \u2022 Guest\n\n\n  \u2022 Ihaveseentherealterrorists\n\n    I saw someone labeled IDF in the video but I didn\u2019t see anyone labeled Palestinian terrorist.

Did Muslims really come to rule over lands spanning from Morocco to Indonesia and from the Cacus region down to The Maldives through the kindness of their heart?\n    What are they doing in Mali today if not the most brutal form of imperialism?\n    What did they do in Sudan if not the most brutal form of imperialism?\n    What are they doing in Nigeria today if not overt war against the Christian Animists?\n\n    What arethey doing today in Pakistan if not over war against the few remaining Hindus?\n\n    What did they do in Afghanistan centuries ago if not genocide to rid that country of all its Buddhists?\n    And, speaking of Buddhists, what are Muslims doing today in southern Thailand to rationalize the murder of 5,000 Buddhists over the last few years? Are the Muslims killing the Buddhists out of their innate loving kindness?\n\n  \u2022 Arafat\n\n    Olmsted is your typical liberal. Unhappy and unable to resolve his personal conflicts who resorts to causes they know little about because they project their own anger onto complex issues they are unable to truly understand.\n    In the old days people like Olmsted would live their lives scurried away in institutions and arguably the world was better off for it.\n\n  \u2022 Arafat\n\n    I apologize for my previous comment. After doing a little homework it\u2019s clear I could not have been more mistaken and if I hurt professor Olmsted, his family or friends I apologize. This has to be a very difficult time for all of them.\n\n    After looking into this incidence a little bit it\u2019s clear Olmsted is a rare man; one who is willing to stand up for principles that are important and who sees through the SJP\u2019s wall of lies for what it really is, i.e., stealth jihad.\n\n    Olmsted reminds me of other great contemporaries like Geert Wilders, Robert Spencer among others and he is to be admired for showing the courage to confront the fascists of our day.\n\n\n    Here is another example of such a man:\n\n  \u2022 Franczeska\n\n    \u201cArafat\u201d = Barry Sommer."}
{"dataman_score": 4.0, "text": "Anna Karenina\n\nLeo Tolstoy\n\nChapter 16\n\nOn the way home Levin asked all details of Kitty's illness and the Shtcherbatskys' plans, and thogh he would have been ashamed to admit it, he was pleased at what he heard. He was pleased that there was still hope, and still more pleased that she should be suffering who had made him suffer so much. But when Stepan Arkadyevitch began to speak of the causes of Kitty's illness, and mentioned Vronsky's name, Levin cut him short.\n\n\nStepan Arkadyevitch smiled harly perceptibly, catching the instantaneous change he knew so well in Levin's face, which had become as gloomy as it had been bright a minute before.\n\n\"Have you quite settled about the forest with Ryabinin?\" asked Levin.\n\n\"Yes, it's settled. The price is magnificent; thirty-eight thousand. Eight straight away, and the rest in six years. I've been bothering about it for ever so long. No one would give more.\"\n\n\"Then you've as good as given away your forest for nothing,\" said Levin gloomily.\n\n\"How do you mean for nothing?\" said Stepan Arkadyevitch with a good-humored smile, knowing that nothing would be right in Levin's eyes now.\n\n\"Because the forest is worth at least a hundred and fifty roubles the acre,\" answered Levin.\n\n\"Oh, these farmers!\" said Stepan Arkadyevitch playfully. \"Your tone of contempt for us poor townsfolk!...But when it comes to business, we do it better than any one. I assure you I have reckoned it all out,\" he said, \"and the forest is fetching a very good price--so much so that I'm afraid of this fellow's crying off, in fact. You know it's not timber'\" said Stpan Arkadyevitch, hoping by this distinction to convince Levin completely of the unfairness of his doubts. \"And it won't run to more than twenty-five yards of fagots per acre, and he's giving me at the rate of seventy roubles the acre.\"\n\nLevin smiled contemptuously. \"I know,\" he thought, \"that fahion not only in him, but in all city people, who, after being twice in ten years in the country, pick up two or three phrases and use them in season and out of season, firmly persuaded that they know all about it. Timber, run to so many yards the acre.' He says those words without understanding them himself.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't attempt to teach you what you write about in your office,\" said he, \"and if need arose, I shoudl come to you to ask about it. But you're so positive you know all the lore of the forest. It's difficult. Have you counted the trees?\"\n\n\"How count the trees?\" said Stepan Arkadyevitch, laughing, still trying to draw his friend out of his ill-temper. \"Count the sands of the sea, number the stars. Some higher power might do it.\"\n\n\"Oh, well, the higher power of Ryabinin can. Not a single merchant ever buys a forest without counting the trees, unless they get it given them for nithing, as you're doing now. I know your forest. I go there every year shooting, and your forest's worth a hundred and fifty roubles and acre paid dwon, while he's giving you sixty by installments. So that in fact you're making him a present of thirty thousand.\"\n\n\"Come, don't let your imagination run away with you,\" said Stepan Arkadyevitch piteously. \"Why was it none would give it, then?\"\n\n\"Why, because he has an understanding with the merchants; he's bought them off. I've had to do with all of them; I know them. They're not merchants, you know: they're speculators. He wouldn't look at a bargain that gave him ten, fifteen per cent profit, but holds back to buy a rouble's worth for twenty kopecks.\"\n\n\"Well, enough of it! You're out of temper.\"\n\n\"Not the least,\" said Levin gloomily, as they drove up to the house.\n\nAt the steps there stood a trap tightly covered with iron and leather, with a sleek horse tightly harnessed with broad collar-straps. In the trap sat the chubby, tightly belted clerk who served Ryabinin as coachman. Ryabinin himself was already in the house, and met the friends in the hall. Ryabinin was a tall, thinnish, middle-aged man, with mustache and a projecting clean-shaven chin, and promined muddy-looking eyes. He was dressed in a long-skirted blue coat, with buttons below the waist at the back, and wore high boots wrinkled over the ankles and striaght over the calf, with big goloshes drawn over them. He rubbed his face with his handkerchief, and wrapping round him his coat, which sat extremely well as it was, he greeted them with a smile, holding out his hand to Stepna Arkadyevitch, as though he wanted to catch something.\n\n\"So here you are,\" said Stepan Arkadyevitch, giving him his hand.\n\n\"That's capital.\"\n\n\"I did not venture to disregard your excellency's commands, though the road was extremely bad. I positively walked the whole way, but I am here at my time. Konstantin Dmitrievitch, my respects\"; he turned to Levin, trying to seize his hand too. But Levin, scowling, made as though he did not notice his hand, and took out the snipe. \"Your hnors have been diverting yourselves with the chase? What kind of bird may it be, pray?\" added Ryabinin, looking contemptuously at the snipe: \"a great delicacy, I suppose.\" And he shook his head disapprovingly, as though he had grave doubts whether this game were worth the candle.\n\n\"Would you like to go into my study?\" Levin said in French to Stepan Arkadyevitch, scowling morosely. \"Go into my study; you can talk there.\"\n\n\"Quite so, where you please,\" said Ryabinin with contemptuous dignity, as though wishing to make it felt that others might be in difficulties as to how to behave, but that he could never be in any difficulty about anything.\n\nOn entering the study Ryabinin looked about, as his habit was, as though seeking the holy picture, but when he had found it, he did not cross himself. He scanned the bookcases and bookshelves, and with the same dubious air with which he had regarded thesnipe, he smiled contemptuously and hook his head disapprovingly, as though by no means willing to allow that this game were worth the candle.\n\n\n\"Oh, don't trouble about the money. I've come to see you to talk it over.\"\n\n\n\"I don't mind if I do,\" said Ryabinin, sitting down and leaning his elbows on the back of his chair in a position of the intensest discomfort to himself. \"You muyst knock it down a bit, prince. It would be too bad. The money is ready conclusively to the last farthing. As to paying the money down, there'll be no hitch there.\"\n\nLevin, who had meanwhile been putting his gun away in the cupboard, was just going out of the door, but catching the merchant's words, he stopped.\n\n\"Why, you've got the forest for nothing as it is,\" he said. \"He came to me too late, or I'd have fixed the price for him.\"\n\n\n\"Very close about money is Konstantin Dmitrievitch,\" he said with a smile, turning to Stepan Arkadyevitch; \"there's positively no dealing with him. I was bargaining for some wheat of him, and a pretty price I offered too.\"\n\n\"Why should I give you my goods for nothing? I didn't pick it up on the ground, nor steal it either.\"\n\n\"Mercy on us! nowadays there's no chance at all of stealing. With the open courts and everything done in style, nowadays there's no question of stealing. We are just talking things over like gentlemen. His excellency's asking too much for the forest. I can't make both ends meet over it. I must ask for a little concession.\"\n\n\"But is the thing settled between you or not? If it's settled, it's useless haggling; but if it's not,\" said Levin, \"I'll buy the forest.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's all youthfulness--positively nothing but boyishness. Why, I'm buying it, upon my honor, simply, believe me, forthe glore of it, that Ryabinin, and no one else, should have bought the copse of Oblonsky. And as to the profits, why, I must make what God gives. In God's name. If you would kindly sign the title-deed...\"\n\n\n\n\"That's so,\" responed the clerk, handing him the reins and buttoning the leather apron. \"But I can congratulate you on the purchase, Mihail Ignatitch?\"\n\n\"Well, well...\""}

Doug Lesmerises of thinks Michigan, Michigan State, Indiana and Wisconsin all have more NBA talent than Ohio State. And, he\u2019s correct.\n\n\nYes, Michigan State\u2019s Gary Harris is struggling. But he is looking forward, not back. He\u2019s coming off a 3-of-20 shooting effort in a loss at Wisconsin and is averaging just 12.3 points in the last four games while hitting only 7-of-30 shots from three-point land.

Facyson had been on campus at Virginia Tech for about a month and was feeling a little homesick.\n\nHe's always had great relationships with his parents and stepparents, so his dad's response was a shock to the system. The answer from his 24-year Navy veteran dad was no.\n\nFacyson, who is one of seven freshmen on Tech's football roster to enroll early in January and participate in spring practices, needed to get used to time away from home. Among those early enrolling true freshmen, Facyson and left tackle Jonathan McLaughlin have made themselves at home the quickest.\n\n\"I think what really got me at first was me being here, and my friends still being in high school,\" said Facyson, a 6-foot-2, 183-pound cornerback who graduated in December from Northgate High in Newnan, Ga. \"It took me a little while to adjust. I wanted to go home a couple of weekends, but my dad just wouldn't let me.\"\n\nFacyson's dad, Frederick, spoke to the father of Tech sophomore J.C. Coleman, a running back who enrolled early in January 2012, about the virtues of enrolling early. Coleman's dad said the extra practice time and exposure to college life was a big help, according to Brandon.\n\nA couple months after he first asked to come home, Brandon is grateful for his dad refusing to welcome his own son back home.\n\n\"I feel like I'm putting in the work,\" said Facyson, who is majoring in biology after graduating high school with a 3.9 grade point average, and who aspires to become a cardiologist. \"I'm learning. I'm making mistakes, but that's normal for an incoming freshman.\"\n\nFacyson worked Saturday in a scrimmage with the second team defense behind starter Kyle Fuller, while McLaughlin has already ascended to first-team left tackle, ahead of junior Mark Shuman. Facyson had an interception in the scrimmage.\n\nAmong the other early enrollees, defensive tackle Woody Baron is also working with the second-team defense. Left tackle Parker Osterloh, a freshman who graduated early from Warhill High, is on the third-team offense. Fullback Jerome Wright, defensive end Seth Dooley and quarterback/wide receiver Carlis Parker all are getting reps deeper down the depth chart.\n\nMcLaughlin, a 6-4, 306-pound native of Mauldin, S.C., isn't your average early enrollee. He spent last fall as a high school postgraduate at Fork Union Military Academy.\n\n\"I'm somewhat surprised, but I've worked hard this spring,\" said McLaughlin of playing with the first team. \"I don't know if I'll be there next week or not, but I'm going to keep working until I'm there.\n\n\"(Enrolling early is) a big advantage. You get to learn the offense as soon as possible. The sooner you learn the offense, the better you can get at technique.\"\n\nNothing is written in stone on Tech's offensive line, especially with so much shuffling taking place after spring practice-ending injuries to starting left guard David Wang and backup guard Nick Acree.\n\nAndrew Miller, who is normally the starting center, is playing right guard. Brent Benedict, who is usually the starting right guard, is at left guard. Caleb Farris is working at first team center, and Laurence Gibson is at first-team right tackle.\n\n\"We're trying to put pressure on people to perform and moving people around, finding out where people fit and creating a lot of competition in that area,\" Tech first-year offensive coordinator Scot Loeffler said.\n\nOne of the players who has to be feeling the most pressure is Shuman, a once highly recruited prospect who now finds himself playing behind a guy who's been on Tech's campus for three months.\n\n\"I'll be interested to see how Mark blocked (in Saturday's scrimmage), but your effort and your consistency, I think that all goes into who's on first team and who's on second team,\" said Tech coach Frank Beamer, who added he likes McLaughlin's athleticism and mentality. \"During spring, it can always change daily. We want (Shuman) to really come along.\"\n\nWhile McLaughlin continues to excel on the offensive side, Facyson is learning under the watchful eye of defensive backs coach Torrian Gray. Facyson said he's gotten used to the push-ups Gray makes him do when he messes up \"the little things\" on the field.\n\n\"He just wants the little things right, because when the little things are right, the bigger things will come,\" Facyson said.\n\nFacyson finally made it back home over spring break, but the old neighborhood doesn't look the same. Blacksburg is getting to be a more inviting place every day.\n\n\"I'm not homesick anymore,\" Facyson said.\n\nDaily Press Articles"}

The justices, voting 8-1, threw out the criminal conviction of Robert Stevens of Pittsville, Va., who was sentenced to three years in prison for videos he made about pit bull fights.\n\nWhat do you think?

This is another one of Obama's schemes to strip us of more of our freedoms. Particularly our free speech, where we will no longer be able to do exactly what we are doing now....fighting for our rights/freedoms. This is a ploy to strip us of our gun rights as well as our free speech. It is just like the healthcare bill where many of our freedoms were stripped that had absolutely nothing to do with healthcare. I hope people wake up and realize what this socialist/Hitler is doing to our country.\n\n\n  \u2022 As a hunter, I am very happy to see this law overturned. I try to see how every law could be abused by the wrong person (people), and this one was easily pushed beyond the limits. It was not a stretch to see this law used to ban all hunting and fishing videos. Isn't Babe Winkelman torturing those poor fish before he let's them go? Even if you believe that this law was passed with good intentions, the language was so broad that it was ripe for abuse.\n\n    2 Recommendations\n\n\n    Eric wrote: \"Even if you believe that this law was passed with good intentions, the language was so broad that it was ripe for abuse.\" The \"animal rights\" INDUSTRY (e.g., H$U$,Peta,et al) LOVES broad language, and they (esp. H$U$) often provide \"model\" laws which definitely tread on the Bill of Rights guarantees. H$U$'s CEO, Wayne Pacelle, has made it plain many times in the past (though he's trying to re-write history as to what he said and the radical agenda it exposes) that he is AGAINST hunting, for example, as well as denying constitutional protections for *animal owners* if in the AR industry's view they are not taking *perfect* care of not-too-many animals. Of course, this is all their \"propaganda mill\" BIG LIES, and throws up a smokescreen of their true agenda--no animal use.\n\n    There are PLENTY of web sites now that expose the \"animal rights\" heavyweights, in particular, and explain the polar difference between animal rights and animal welfare. We protect accused human x human criminals, but the attempt is to treat animal neglect/cruelty as equivalent to human x human crimes as equal in heinousness--BUT take away an *accused* animal abuser's constitutional rights, i.e., guilty unless you have enough money (thousands) to fight in court against your accusers--and most don't They are often selected *because they are good victims* who can't defend themselves, therefore allowing in way too many cases *seizure under color of law* that is sanctioned and allowed by \"the system\".\n\n    The AR industry knows how to use legal means and lobbying, as well as their \"propaganda\" to tweak, distort, pass laws that have some good intention and LOTS of wiggle room to go after animal owners--this applies to pet owners, pet breeders, rescues, livestock owners/breeders/processors, i.e., ANY use of animals that can be smeared/vilified. The H$U$, for example, has many animal law attorneys on staff to write \"model\" legislation that will *incrementally* fruther the AR agenda. Same thing for the ALDF---incremental laws that make animal ownership and use more difficult, more regulated and unpleasant, and more expensive, so that people will just quit rather than take a chance on being a target (even if wrongfully so).\n\n    The media cooperates in this AR-promoted farce, and people's lives are ruined at the get-go--guilty unless they can afford to defend themselves in court.

The ports of entry are offices at the first point of contact between immigrants or visitors and the immigration service at the Canadian border. The first ports of entry were the ocean ports described under the Records of Entry and the \"border ports of entry\" first established in 1908. The present practice of officially designating these offices by Order in Council did not begin until some time after this date. The number of ports of entry has varied from just under one hundred in 1908 to 687 in April 1986. Ports of entry perform the first inspection (now referred to as the PIL or Primary Inspection Line) and if necessary refer the immigrant to the next or secondary inspection at an office \"inland\" - now the Canada Immigration Centre. Many port of entry offices have been and are staffed not by Immigration employees but by Customs officers performing immigration duties by formal arrangement between the two departments. Generally speaking, short-term visitors to Canada are documented, if they are recorded at all, only at the port of entry. The Canada Immigration Centres or CICs grew out of the port of entry offices, and were first established in their present form shortly after 1966 (date of the creation of the new Department of Manpower and Immigration and the counterpart Canada Manpower Centres). They provide a wider range of services to immigrants than the ports of entry, generally after the immigrant has passed the primary inspection at the port (some ports of entry are, however, combined with or adjacent to the CIC, in contrast to the \"inland CICs\" which serve more than one port and may be located away from the border area). The CIC thus is responsible for the reception of persons who cannot be dealt with in a final way at the border without further examination - what is now called \"secondary\" inspection. It also provides some types of advice and documentation needed by immigrants and visitors already within the country. The CIC may also have enforcement staff to deal with immigration irregularities; in a few major centres partially independent \"enforcement CICs\" have been set up to deal with large volumes of illegal cases. The CIC is not, however, responsible for settlement/ adjustment services for immigrants already accepted and living in Canada; these since 1966 have been provided separately through the Canada Manpower/Employment Centres. Generally speaking, therefore, the CIC is the main responsibility centre and office of record for the acceptance of immigrants and control of immigration irregularities at the field office level. The records in this series relate to the functions and activities of a variety of CICs from across the country.\n\nTextual records\n32: Restricted by law\nAccess to the majority of the unprocesse\nd accessions in this series is restricted.

It is faster and more agile than the Police Patrol. The Police Cruiser's chassis is also shared with Vapid's NOOSE Cruiser and Taxi. The grill was probably inspired by toy police cars that can be found in several stores in New York, which are based in the Ford Crown Victoria but have a larger, more rectangular grill and lack of manufacturer emblem.\nA Police Cruiser when the player is busted in GTA Chinatown Wars.\nZSAdded by ZS\n\nThe Police Cruiser is an amalgamation of various Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptors, thus probably powered by a tuned V8. Its tail lights are similar to those of a 1992-1994 model; the chassis, including: windows, headlights (however upside down, similar to a 1992-1997 Mercury Grand Marquis), and front and rear bumpers resemble those of the 1992-97 models; and the grille and hood look like those of the 1998-2011 models. The dashboard instrument cluster is unlike the Ford product, consisting of only a tachometer, speedometer, fuel gauge and temperature gauge rather than the Crown Victoria's speedo, tach, central screen and gauges for fuel, temperature, oil pressure and volts.\n\nThe Police Cruiser does not appear as a drivable car in GTA Chinatown Wars (as the Police Patrol is the only police car in the game), but does occasionally surface as an aesthetic element of \"busted\" sequences, when a pre-rendered depiction of a modified Police Cruiser may be seen.\n\n\nIn GTA V, the Vapid Police Cruiser is a vehicle used by the Los Santos Police Department. In the announcement trailer, a sports car is chased by a Police Cruiser. The new Police Cruiser boasts a white and black livery with LSPD markings. The skin is modled off of LAPD's iconic police skin, also instead of a V-BAR type lights,it has standerd police car lights. The Vapid Police car seems to have a new handeling line which will fix the problem, that if go around a corner fast and hit the curb your car will flip. From the trailer you can spot 3 different police vehicles that will patrol along side the standerd crusier in the city, in the countryside there is a \"Sheriff's Cruiser\"\u00a0variant of the Vapid Police crusier. It is painted white and will probably be found along the city limits and beyond. The variant will probably have the same V-8 Interceptor Engine.\n\nPolice Cruiser\nBased off the Ford Crown Victoria, here is the LSPD/SAPD Vapid Police cruiser, very similar to the one from GTA IV.\n\n\n\nThe Police Cruiser's high-performance V-8 (which real life variant is Ford's Police Interceptor V-8 engine) produces an impressive amount of torque off the line, and accelerates well. It has a low rev limit, which can be felt at higher rpms. Also, the engine feels as if it runs out of steam before the transmission switches gear. It has a higher top speed than its Declasse-branded competitor, but will not get there faster than the latest Bravado offering.\n\n\n\n\nAnother variant of the Police Cruiser in TBoGT, internally named \"policew\", oddly exists as a completely wrecked but drivable version of the GTA IV Police Cruiser. Depicted with a completely charred bodywork, the policew has no siren, non-functional lights and no radio, and emits a horn sounding like that of the Brickade's. Despite being a wreck, the policew is still vulnerable to damage from collisions and weapons. The vehicle however still has well above average performance, one nearly of that comparable to the Police Buffalo, instead of the regular performance as found in its un-wrecked Vapid counterpart. It has the motor sound of that found in the Police Buffalo, and its acceleration is the equivalent, along with top speed, and handling. The physical motor acts as if nothing is wrong with it, and runs as healthy as any good motor. Aside mods or hacking, the policew is otherwise unobtainable in the game. The car is regarded as a conventional traffic vehicle, and as a result, may also spawn in traffic if the player is driving a policew themselves.\n\nUse in side-missions\n\nWhen the player is stationary in any police vehicle they can access the Police Computer (this is done by pressing the L1 button (PlayStation 3), the LB button (Xbox 360), or the E key (PC), which lets Niko search for the most wanted criminals, monitor recent crimes in the area, search the police records and even call for backup. This is where the player can start the Vigilante-style side-missions and the Most Wanted side-missions.\n\n\n  \u2022 Like other emergency vehicles with roof-mounted strobe lights in GTA IV, the Police Cruiser's siren will malfunction by wailing in random, distorted pitches if the strobe light housing is significantly damaged by gunfire, falling objects, or rolling of the vehicle. The second and third sirens noises are also disabled, leaving the car with only the malfunctioning siren noise.\n    \u2022 A bug exists where in GTA IV a fixed police car can be driven with a distorted siren, requiring the \"repair car cheat\", or, in multiplayer, a health kit. However, if the player turns off the siren while it is like this, then turns it back on, it will return to normal.\n  \u2022 In GTA IV multiplayer, the Police Cruiser, Enforcer, and the Annihilator are the only vehicles used by law enforcement, regardless of one's Wanted level.\n  \u2022 On the GTA IV DVD case, a Police Cruiser can be seen. However, the Police Cruiser on the case has the headlights and front bumper of a 1998\u20132011 Crown Victoria, when compared to the in-game model.\n  \u2022 In multiplayer, the Police Cruiser has a normal radio; the same applies to all other emergency vehicles, and the Securicar.\n  \u2022 In the Beta, the Police Cruiser had a registration number on the trunk, instead of the LCPD logo.\n\n\n  \u2022 Be careful when attempting to \"save\" a Police Cruiser (or Police Patrol) in a parking spot. Often times police officers will just enter the car and drive off, despite it being parked in \"your\" parking spot. This occurs with either a lone policeman, or if a policeman is chasing and apprehending a non-player criminal on the street then both will enter the car and the police officer will drive off. This tends to occur more often after just loading a save.\nAdvertisement | Your ad here\n\nAround Wikia's network\n\nRandom Wiki"}

She's usually very cuddly but she's been velcroed to me - following me from room to room, curling up next to me wherever I am, trying to get into my lap constantly. It's either because I'm a target of opportunity since I'm not at work or she's freaked out that I'm acting differently.\n\n    Just wondering if other people's dogs do this.\n\n  2. #2\n    My dog also acted differently when I was feeling sick. He didn't ask to go outside as often, seemed to be quieter and calmer too. He also seemed to be more cuddly. I suppose any change in routine is cause for concern for our dogs.\n\n  3. #3\n    When I am sick my dog clings to me until I am 100 percent well again. She does not let me out of her sight. What was really fun was when I was pregnant with my daughter she got extremely clingy a few days before I found out and for the duration of the nine months not only was she overly clingy she was extra protective. She wouldn't let our other dog at the time near me at all. She would barracade herself between me and other people. The only person she would let near me was my husband. (She wasn't mean or anything about it, she would just position herself constantly between me and other people and animals, okay she was a jerk to the other dog though about it)\n\n    So yeah I think when you are sick (or pregnant) they sense something different is going on.\n\n  4. Absolutely! All of my dogs over the years have been very clingy when I'm sick. Harley and Jake have the names Nancy Nurse and Doctor Death for this reason.\n\n  5. #5\n    Yes they do...they look at me like...\"so does this mean we are going to get less attention and no walks?...you selfish $#@!...\"\n\n  6. #6\n    Quote Originally Posted by Fieldmarshal View Post\n    That is EXACTLY how Peyton is.

When we are sick, she's 50 times worse. She HAS to be laying between your legs when you're laying down. Makes for a lot of fun when you have to rush to the bathroom. lol.\n\n  8. Every dog I ever had seems to sense the mood and well being of their owner. I think it is inherent in a dogs senses. Plain and simple dogs sense stuff we cannot. They have even discovered dogs that can detect cancer. Yes your dog knows when things are not right with you physically and emotionally, and will typically calm down and become a source of comfort. They expect you to know when they need you and they know when you need them.\n\n  9. No, my dogs act exactly the same as they usually do. When I'm upset though, they act differently.\n\n    Like now, since thinking about what to do with Serenity, she is acting very different from her normal self at times. It's quite annoying. Which just makes me feel bad.\n\n    So, I'm sure they know when I'm sick, they just don't care.\n\n  10. Mine definitely know when I'm sick. They are a lot more clingy I guess you could say. Want to be close to me.....well even more than usual LOL. When I hurt myself, OMG they are all over me like stink on $#@! trying to make me feel better. :)\n\n  11. I dont really get sick but she went ballistic when I sprained my foot and I was limping on crutches\n\n  12. I've been sick for the past three weeks; Andy has yet to give a rat's patootie.\n\n  13. #13\n    Join Date\n    Dec 2008\n    The Murder Mitten\n    Yup. Lucy pretty much pins me to the bed until I'm well, or bf comes to drag me out for work. She's a good little fever inducer though, cuts my sick time in half after 12 hours of sweating my cold out.\n\n  14. #14\n    My friend got cancer and had surgury and star actually stopped jumping up on her and he was bad about it. He got so excited to see her\n\n  15. #15\n    Join Date\n    Jul 2008\n    In Peanut's world\n    well i was sick yesterday (no more bratwurst for me) Peanut ignored me when he normally is clingy. I couldn't get him to visit me he went off to my family to hang out with them since he got to play with them. when i started feeling a little better he must have sensed that because he brought me his toy to play inside fetch with him. He has been back to clingy today. i guess i have the backwards brat :)\n\n  16. #16\n    Join Date\n    May 2008\n    New England\n    Quote Originally Posted by WoolyBully View Post\n    Yes, I'm wondering where people are getting these wonderfully empathetic Florence Nightengale dogs.

(Actually I think she senses when I am not at my best and exploits the fact that I am high on cold medicine.)\n\n  17. #17\n    I have a chronic pain disorder called Trigeminal neuralgia and when I am in bed due to a pain attack my dogs (Samson an APBT and Daphne a miniature schnauzer) stay right with me. If I don't get up and make them go out to potty and eat they won't.\n    Also Daphne has started kind of knowing when the pain is going to flare up and she will get in my face and smell my breath....I know when she does this to start taking pain medicine to try and stave off the worst of the pain. If she was younger and more social with dogs (lol) I would love to make her a service dog so I could go out more and stuff without the fear of a pain attack coming on without warning and incapacitating me.....\n\nSimilar Threads\n\n  1. \"Dog Attack\" gets reported differently when its not a \"pit Bull\"\n    By Chevy in forum General Dog Discussions\n    Replies: 18\n    Last Post: 01-04-2012, 03:20 PM\n  2.

{"dataman_score": 4.0, "text": "Hire best candidates ?for police and fire jobs\n\nCheektowaga, Lancaster and many other towns throughout Western New York hire the best and the brightest. Recently in Lancaster and Cheektowaga, they were comparing candidates who all scored in the top 1 percent on a recent police exam. Candidates then go through a thorough background check and character evaluation. No matter who they choose, they are getting a top candidate for years to come.\n\nSo why are the citizens of Buffalo being shortchanged when it comes to police and fire candidates? Why should the city be forced to select inferior candidates? Why do the Police and Fire Departments accept candidates with scores in the 70s? Then when these applicants struggle to maintain a passing grade at their respective academies, they are sometimes passed through.\n\nRecently two fire candidates failed and the fire commissioner refused to terminate them. We're not talking about a clerical position here, we're talking about potential firefighters who will someday make decisions that could mean the difference between life or death. Decisions that could save a citizen's life or a firefighter's life. All citizens and firefighters deserve candidates they can depend on if their lives are on the line.\n\nIf needed, have civil service exams every two years instead of every four years. Let the commissioner hire the secretaries and clerical staff, that's where his strengths are. And leave the training and evaluations up to the chief of training, who sees these candidates every day for two months. Why not expect the best and brightest when it comes to life-and-death situations? To all of Buffalo's bravest, stay safe.\n\nPhil Ryan\n\nRetired Buffalo fire lieutenant\n\nWest Seneca\n\n\nMore respect needed ?to solve our problems\n\nThanks to Michelle Boorstein for her Viewpoints article pointing out the reality of one of our most challenging issues today, religious freedom. Being founded on democratic principles of the individual's right to freedom of religious and political beliefs, our society has become so complex we're on overload. I just hope and pray that people in our country with whatever heritage and belief systems can take a step back from the conflicts.\n\nI believe that respect for each other as human beings has to come into play to solve our challenges. This means respect for each other's needs, thoughts and rights. The arguments are all about how people as much as possible can achieve some kind of contentment and security in their lives. If we don't start finding common ground and respect for each other, the individual freedoms don't have a chance!\n\nGaylynn Long\n\n\n\nEnergy project will bring ?low-cost power to state\n\nThe Aug. 11 News story, \"Energy plan may raise upstate cost,\" nearly exclusively aired the opposition. The Champlain Hudson Power Express project, an innovative, underwater 333-mile transmission line, will bring clean, low-cost power to New York State, and will not raise upstate power prices, according to economic studies conducted by London Economics International.\n\nThe Champlain Hudson Power Express will lower costs to energy consumers across the state by an estimated $650 million annually. The New York Public Service Commission estimates these savings may be as high as $720 million. While it is true that these cost savings would mainly occur in the Hudson Valley, the New York metro area and Long Island, upstate power prices will remain stable.\n\nThe clean hydro power that will be transported on this line will come from new generation sources now being developed and will not take any low-cost power from Canada that is currently going into upstate and Western New York. Furthermore, since this project is being financed 100 percent by the private sector, ratepayers and taxpayers will not be responsible for any of the costs associated with the development, construction or commercialization of the line. By relying on private sources of funding, the Champlain Hudson Power Express will free up scarce resources needed to upgrade existing transmission systems in Western New York and other areas of the state.\n\nWe agree that New York needs many new projects to address its long-term energy future, and this project is only one piece of a larger puzzle. That said, with this project, New York has an opportunity to bring this low-cost power to the state and with it cut energy rates, create jobs and deliver cleaner air without the need for an overhead transmission line running down state.\n\nDonald Jessome\n\nPresident and CEO, TDI\n\n\nFudoli has insulted ?workers and veterans\n\nOn Aug. 20, Erie County employees gathered outside of the Lancaster Town Hall in protest of remarks made by Town Supervisor Dino Fudoli. It seems he believes that government is the enemy and all government employees are lazy. If that's what he thinks, then that's what he thinks. The folks who assembled wanted to be certain that Fudoli understands that they are not all like their fellow government employee Dino Fudoli.\n\nThis came about at the same time that Fudoli is trying to nix a veterans cemetery from being established in Lancaster. Right now, the closest veterans cemetery to Erie County is in Bath. Some of the people in the crowd were U.S. veterans and they felt insulted by Fudoli. It seems he would rather see a hamburger served than a place that honors those who served their country. I'm sure most of the people in Lancaster feel differently than Fudoli. Fudoli is excelling at giving Lancaster a black eye, but not much else. Bob Giza, where are you?\n\nBob Farmer\n\n\n\nAmherst must integrate? nature with community\n\nAmherst residents are hearing that we need to \"swap\" the Westwood Country Club for the Audubon Golf Course so that it can be used for a massive development complex. This move is being touted as necessary to fully integrate the University at Buffalo with the community. In reality, we have been integrating UB for decades and have done it well. A more pressing issue for Amherst, however, is integrating nature with the community. The preservation of green space and the integration of nature has always been a significant part of the appeal of Amherst and a reason many chose to live here.\n\nIt is both sad and embarrassing that Amherst now has the reputation of being a haven for mindless overdevelopment. A condition and portrayal other communities work diligently to avoid.\n\nCritical thinking and logical consequences inextricably link the pattern of developing green space with the destruction of wildlife and their habitats. If we continue along the road of developing our remaining green spaces, even though existing developed spaces remain vacant, we can expect more of our \"nuisance\" wildlife being displaced and eliminated. Unfortunately, it is the inhumane killing of Amherst beavers that brought to the forefront the importance of our responsibility in balancing and integrating nature within the community.\n\nJudy Ferraro"}

Mikey's Point Of View.\n\nCategory:\u00a0My Chemical Romance - Rating:\u00a0PG-13 - Genres:\u00a0Drama,Humor,Romance - Characters:\u00a0Mikey Way - Published:\u00a02011-05-26 - Updated:\u00a02011-05-26 - 1258\u00a0words\n\nI carefully took the dress, the exact same dress she tried on, out of the bag and put it into the box, then wrapped it. She's going to be surprised. I thought of what would be the look on her face when she saw it. I know she likes the dress, I just hope she'll accept it. I still felt a little bad about guilting her, but I just wanted to get her a present. I think she'll accept it. Alex's art thing is tonight. She's sleeping over my house after and Gerard's gonna be sleeping at Frank's house tonight which makes it even better. Just me and her. I got some of the newer Doctor Who seasons on DVD and Nightmare Before Christmas and I got Gummy Bears, Skittles, Jelly Belly jelly beans, Cherry 7up (one of Alex's favorites), A&W cream soda, and vegan friendly cookies. I even made blueberry muffins (one of Alex's favorite foods). My mom and dad are still out of town on buisness. They're never home but they still pay the bills and keep food on the table. I made my mind change subjects. Gee was upstairs straightening his hair and putting on eyeliner getting ready to go pick up Frank. Hayden said he had a ride and Alex's dad was driving her. Her mom wouldn't come. She said it was a waste of time. Sometimes I wish I could just strangle the woman. Alex's stepmom and grandparents and three of her siblings were all gonna be there, but not only will her mom not come but she also totally dissed the whole thing. I reminded myself to forget about Alex's mom and focus on the idea that soon I'd be seeing Alex.\n\n\"Hey Gee, I'll be back soon. I want to go do something before we leave.\" I grabbed the car keys and left with the gift.\n\nI nervously rang the doorbell. Alex's dad opened the door.\n\n\"Hi Mikey.\" he said smiling. \"Come on in.\" I walked in and after making a bit of small talk went upstairs to be greeted by Alex's four year old brother Hiro and two year old sister Lisa who immediatly tried to tackle me.\n\n\"We got you!\" Hiro screamed.\n\n\"Got you!\" Lisa screamed out laughing.\n\n\"Awex! We've got your boyfriend captive! Can we make him walk the plank?!\" Hiro called out.\n\n\"Arrrrr me hearties, me thinks we should let him live and make him swab the deck. Do ye concur?\"\n\n\n\"Aye!\" their little kid voices yelled in unison.\n\n\"Or ye could join our crew under the black flag of the Jolly Roger and live forever in infamy!\" Alex offered as she stepped into view with a pirate hat on.\n\n\"Forever in infamy!\" her two siblings screamed enthusiastically.\n\n\"It would be my honor to sail the seven seas with such an incredible captin and crew.\" I said bowing as the to little ones released me. Alex threw me a wooden sword. \"Forever in infamy!\" I cheered holding my sword up high.\n\n\"FOREVER IN INFAMY!\" they all shouted, drawing their swords and raising them high and proud.\n\n\"So me matey, why havest ye come?\" Alex asked me while her brother and sister ran around excitedly.\n\n\"Fair maiden,\" I took her hand as I got down on one knee and kissed her hand. \"I havest come to bestow upon you this token of my gratitude.\" And with that I handed her the present. Her eyes got all wide and sparkly. She carefully untied the ribbon then slowly tore off the paper. After she got off all the paper, she opened the box.\n\nHer eyes got wide as saucer dishes. Her beautiful mouth formed a little o as she stared at it. She blinked a couple times and I got ready for her to refuse to keep it.\n\n\"Mikes, you...thank you!\" she threw her arms around me and hugged me really hard. \"Mikey you really shouldn't of! I don't deserve it!\" she said, still hugging me.\n\n\"Trust me, you do.\" I said, completely serious.\n\n\"Thank you Mikes.\" she started nibbling my ear lightly. I surpressed a moan.\n\n\"Should we take this to the bedroom?\" she nodded. I carried her bridal style into her room and set her on the bed. She went back to nibbling on my ear. \"Such a tease.\" I said. She giggled and kissed me. I deepened the kiss. We kept kissing, but suddenly Alex stopped.\n\n\"What's wrong?\" I whispered to her. I looked down and realized I had one hand cupping her breast. I could immediatly feel myself blushing. I took my hand off. \"Sorry. I guess I got um, carried away.\" I saw that Alex was blushing too. I didn't want to crowd her, so I inched away a little. Alex threw her arms around me and hugged me.\n\n\"Mikes, it's fine. I'm not mad I just...just don't want to go that far right now. I mean, my little siblings are in the other room. My dad's right there, and I've got to go to an art gallery soon, and honestly I want to stay a virgin a little longer.\" I nodded. I knew already that she liked being a virgin. And I already knew about her siblings and dad and stepmom. Alex was quiet for a while.\n\n\"I'm sorry.\" I said.\n\n\"You shouldn't be.\"\n\n\"Yes I should. I violated your personal space and your privacy and I made you feel uncomfortable. So, I'm sorry.\"\n\n\"Personal space?\" she said, giggling. \"Mikey, you're tongue was in me mouth and mine was in your's, does that seem like I wanted more personal space?\" she kept giggleing as she continued talking. \"And privacy, you're in my bedroom on my bed, that's pretty private. And trust me, it didn't feel uncomfortable, it felt great.\" She gave me a quick kiss. \"No one should be sorry, I'm just not ready for that right now.\" We started kissing again, but more like the gentle, sweet, slow kind of kisses. I almost told her. I almost told her that I like her more than like a friend. I didn't though. We heard a little knock at the door. We broke the kiss.\n\n\"Hey, can I come in?\" Alex's dad said. Alex an I looked at each other.\n\n\"Sure.\" I responded. He came in the door and closed it behind him.\n\n\"Alex, could you start getting ready please? We're leaving in ten minutes.\"\n\n\"Okay!\" Alex gave me a kiss on the cheek and hugged her dad and left the room.\n\n\"Mikey, can I talk to you?\" I had a feeling that this was about to happen.\n\n\n\"Well, I know that you're really important and really close to my daughter. I also know that she's spending the night at your place tonight, and that no one else will be there. I'm going to have to trust you, okay?\" I nodded. \"She's still in highschool and I know you to have been friends a very long time, but I need to know that you'll keep what's best for her in mind. I respect whatever choice she makes, but I'd like you two to keep the future in mind, okay?\"\n\n\"Okay.\" I replied nodding.\n\n\"So, as long as you promise to respect Alex's decisions, you're aloud to come over as long as Alex wants you here.\" he said taking out a key to the house. \"So, do we have an agreement?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" I said nodding.\n\n\"Good.\" he put the key in my hand. \"Feel free to use it whenever you like.\"\nSign up to rate and review this story"}

{"dataman_score": 4.0, "text": "\n\nBig-noise boys from the Lone Star state, the founders of ...And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead began their career by wrapping brisk little songs in sheets of clamor. The Austin band still does that, but Trail of Dead's latest album -- emphasized at its Thursday show at a packed Rock & Roll Hotel -- often sounds like a less angelic U2. Such new songs as \"Bells of Creation'' (in which singer-guitarist Conrad Keely recalls that he \"felt like Satan'') were characterized by glistening guitar arpeggios, epic dynamic shifts and yearning upward vocals.\n\n(Read the rest of the review after the jump.)\n\nThe group, which over 15 years has expanded from duo to sextet, didn't stick with one format. There was lots of instrument swapping, notably by drummer-guitarist Jason Reece. Some songs featured three guitars crashing in unison, while others rode the rhythms of twin drum kits. The band's rock-orchestral flourishes were even supplemented by a chorus: Members of Midnight Masses, the evening's opening act, helped swell a few of the sing-along refrains.\n\nThe fierce attack seemed appropriate for a band that takes its name from a slogan (perhaps apocryphal) of the bloodthirsty Mayans. But the band was over-amplified, and the players's individual parts often nearly identical, sometimes yielding more sludge than grandeur.\n\nStill, the set included moments of bracing simplicity and deft counterpoint. During \"Far Pavilions,'' a vocal chant ceded to a guitar rave-up, but keyboardist Clay Morris picked up the chant's melody and continued it amid the storm. More touches like that would have benefited a performance that displayed impressive power, but lacked the finesse of Trail of Dead's current studio sound.\n\n\nBy David Malitz\u00a0|\u00a0 February 27, 2009; 12:26 PM ET Live Last Night\nPrevious: Live Last Night: Tom Jones | Next: Live Last Night: Ledisi\n\n\nPlease email us to report offensive comments.\n\nwho authored this?

{"dataman_score": 4.0, "text": "Oct 11, 2012\n\nPosted by | 6 Comments\n\nThe Importance of Attending an Art Conference\n\nThere are many reasons why art teachers don\u2019t attend local art conferences. Some of the most common reasons include the cost of attending (including cost of hotel, food, using a personal day or the district paying for a substitute) and people not thinking the conference is worth their time. I beg you to reconsider attending your local conference, you won\u2019t regret it!\n\nHere\u2019s Why Every Art Teacher Should Attend an Art Conference\n\n\n1. Learn about what\u2019s happening at the state level in art education\n\nMany states are making changes in art education standards. Attending a conference helps you get up to date regarding these changes. The state of Iowa is in the process of adopting a statewide core curriculum for art. The conference allowed me to learn more about the upcoming changes. For those of you interested, here is the website regarding the Iowa Core for Art.\n\n2. Get FREE stuff!\n\nArt education conferences are filled with vendors wanting to show you their new products and give you free samples. Some of these freebies include: markers, glaze, posters, pens, pencils and paper. What art teacher doesn\u2019t like free stuff? Plus, they often have display copies of books and other supplies so you can look at them and try them out before you purchase.\n\n3. Collaborate with other art teachers.\n\nArt conferences are filled with other art teachers. Find a way to collaborate with them. I met numerous art teachers who were willing to share their contact information and share lesson plans or strategies they have used. One teacher even offered to have my visit their classroom. The art conversations didn\u2019t stop once the convention ended. I went to dinner with another art teacher and attended an opening art reception at the art museum. Then I shared a hotel room with a different art teacher. There was art talk from the moment I woke up to the moment I went to bed. I was in art teacher heaven.\n\n4. Get to know new art teachers\n\nCreate connections across the state. You never know when you will have a question and you will need someone else\u2019s expertise. The more conventions you attend and the more people you meet, the bigger your circle of knowledge becomes. Make new friends, but keep the old!\n\n5. Become empowered\n\nAt the Iowa Art Educators conference, I learned: how to better assess my students using both formative and summative assessments, how to advocate for my art program, the importance of public art in our communities and more importantly, in our schools. I walked away from the conference filled with ideas, eager to teach new lessons and was reminded how I am the voice for art in my school and community. I\u2019m empowered to speak louder.\nCheck out Bloom\u2019s Taxonomy\u2026 do you notice anything different?\n\nArt and creativity is important- it\u2019s at the top! (Evaluation used to be at the top)\n\n6. Grow as a professional\n\nArt teachers need professional development that is ridiculously relevant to art. In addition to the AOE classes, a conference allows teachers to learn and grow as an art professional. Many conferences offer graduate credit if you attend the full conference and complete a small assignment.\n\n7. Have Fun! Make ART!\n\nThere are many opportunities to make art at art education conferences. The Iowa conference had a stencil making class and glass fusing class. Doesn\u2019t that sound like a blast? If you don\u2019t end up attending a hands-on art class, at least you will walk away with many new lesson ideas for your students to get messy and creative.\n\nWhy do you take the time to attend Art Conferences?\n\nWhat is your most memorable \u201cAh Ha\u201d from an Art Conference?\n\nPrint Friendly\n  \u2022 http://www.theartofed.com/ Chelsie Meyer\n\n    I agree, you are in art teacher heaven at conferences! I love the opportunity to make art with other art teachers.\n\n  \u2022 Leah Keller\n\n    I will be going to my conference in WI and am SO excited to meet you at your blogging presentation.\u00a0 In fact, I\u2019m driving 2 hours the second day JUST to see/meet you!!\u00a0 Hmmm\u2026 too stalkerish??\n    See you in a few weeks!!\n\n    \u2022 Leah Keller\n\n      \u00a0Ooops!\u00a0 Thought Jessica wrote this post.\u00a0 Sorry Cassidy!!\u00a0 In any case, I\u2019m still excited to go.\u00a0 ;)\n\n    \u2022 http://www.theartofed.com/ Jessica Balsley\n\n      WOW, Leah!

Almost a hundred years ago Charles Beard, perhaps somewhat bitterly, said no:\n\nRealizing the fact that a mere high mortality due to congestion will not seriously disturb a nation that complacently slaughters more people on its railways and in its factories and mines than any other country in the world, mathematically minded reformers are trying to reach the heart of the public through its purse by pointing out that there is a great economic loss in the death of persons of working age.\n\nWhich really works better to grab Americans\u2019 attention?

But this time I fear she has Gone Too Far. Or, perhaps more likely, she\u2019s pulling our collective leg \u2014 though I don\u2019t remember her pulling it in quite this manner before. Even out here at the veriest Edge, the cityscape is clotted with victors\u2019 memories of the War of Eastern Aggression. Just yesterday I was out picknicking with fellow parents of future yuppies at the Black Point Battery; and of course the map is full of streets named for Vicksburg, Grant, Lincoln and the Union.

Those ideas\u2013racial, cultural, martial\u2013are what is going to drive the GOP until they escape their regional status. Jimmy Carter well knows this, and it is no coincidence that the current poster child for Republican obstructionism is South Carolina. We may date the finish of the Civil War to 1865, but the conflict has never really ended.\n\nAugust 24, 2009, 10:59 pm\n\n\nOn this day in 1857, the New York branch of the Ohio Life Insurance and Trust Company (OLITC) failed, an event often (dis)credited with starting the Panic of 1857. But of course the Panic didn\u2019t really begin there; as with all major financial catastrophes the story is more complicated than it initially appears.\n\n\nJuly 31, 2009, 12:49 pm\n\nToo good to be true?\n\nGiven that I haven\u2019t had a chance to read the book in question, I don\u2019t know what to make of the ongoing, and increasingly nasty, fight over John Stauffer\u2019s and Sally Jenkins\u2019s new history of the Free State of Jones. But it seems like the struggle over the book is pretty interesting, as it raises all kinds of questions about the intersection of historical narratives and big-time entertainment. I also think there\u2019s probably something to be said here about the nature of scholarship. But again, without having read the book, I\u2019m not the one to say it. At least not yet.\n\nAnyway, the fight started here and here and here, I guess, when Victoria Bynum, who\u2019s written her own history of Jones County during the Civil War, posted a scathing review of The State of Jones. Take a look. See what you think.\n\nUpdate: Stepping back a bit, it seems to me that there are other interesting questions\u2026\n\nRead More\n\nMay 29, 2009, 1:20 pm\n\nCover with the highest honor.\n\nAs Abraham Lincoln would say.

Obama arrived in Washington via the same train route that Lincoln did in 1861. He swore the oath of office on Lincoln\u2019s bible. He chose the same lunch that Lincoln ate on his inauguration day. And with the nation mired in a dizzying array of crises, Obama says that he looks to Lincoln for inspiration. Ron Paul, meanwhile, did not secure the Republican nomination, despite the passion of his supporters. Nevertheless, he, too, continues to use Lincoln for political purposes. On April 15, Paul and hundreds of thousands of limited-government activists took to the streets to rail about the long reach of federal authority.

In fact, many of the ways that the Medal was previously given no longer hold. Perhaps the most obvious of these is that it is now extremely difficult\u2013if not impossible\u2013to get a Medal of Honor while surviving the acts of bravery. The military denies that this is an official requirement, though there is skepticism:\n\nThe U.S. military appears to have toughened its standards for bestowing the Medal of Honor, the nation\u2019s highest award for valor in battle, to exclude troops who survive their heroic acts, a California lawmaker charged Thursday.\nEither troops are \u201cnot as brave as they used to be, which I don\u2019t believe is true,\u201d or the criteria for the award have been amended \u201cso that you have to die\u201d to receive it, Rep.

Honestly, I feel like I should try to write something grand on this auspicious occasion, but as Frederick Douglass noted in 1876, \u201cno man can say anything that is new of Abraham Lincoln.\u201d Douglass was right. And that was in 1876. So you can imagine how hard it is to be original about Lincoln today. But that hasn\u2019t stopped people, lots of people, from trying. In fact, I\u2019ve just finished reading six new Lincoln books for a longish essay I\u2019m writing to mark the bicentennial. I learned some interesting stuff from these books \u2014 especially from James Oakes\u2019s The Radical and the Republican \u2014 but nothing that changes my basic impression of the man, his politics, or his presidency.

We deal with it because we are legally required to in the by-laws of the Bible but, down deep in our hearts, we are more passionate about discipleship than evangelism.\n\nBut this is where our thinking is wrong. Evangelism and discipleship are like Nitrogen and Gylcerin, they must be blended for maximum effect. Teens who are growing in Christ will share their faith and teens who are sharing their faith in the power of the Spirit will grow in Christ.\n\nI am convinced that if teenagers fall in love with sharing their faith they will fizzle out, but if they fall in love with Jesus they\u2019ll always evangelize. Because of this, our first and foremost goal is to get teenagers fully surrendered to Christ. If they offer their lives as living sacrifices (Romans 12:1), I believe they will passionately share their faith out of the overflow of their love for God!\n\nAt Dare 2 Share we refuse to divorce evangelism from discipleship. In fact, I believe they are intrinsically united. My firm belief is that evangelism accelerates the discipleship process like no Bible study class ever could. When teenagers begin to share their faith, they have a new thirst to study God\u2019s Word, pray, and depend on the Holy Spirit.\n\nFor instance, at our training conferences this year we deal with conquering sin through applying the power of the cross (aka \u201csanctification\u201d) because, and here\u2019s the direct connect with evangelism, if teenagers are living a godless life none of their friends will take them seriously when they are sharing the gospel. So we teach key truths that deal directly with essential \u201cdeep\u201d theology (\u201dthe inerrancy of God\u2019s Word, the Trinity, prayer, worship, the exchanged life, etc) but they ALL make a direct connect to sharing your faith.\n\nEmphasizing evangelism opens up the opportunity for risk and persecution (1 Tim 3:12) and helps teenagers download theology quicker and more effectively. It provides a context that is more like the 1st century Church rather than the 21st century Church. It gives them a bold cause (THE Cause) that is urgent, exciting and life-changing. Teenagers pay attention and are hungry to learn theology because they are being sent into battle for the souls of their friends.\n\nCalibrating theology in light of evangelism \u201cmissionizes\u201d theology and takes it out of the clincial into the practical. Jesus equipped his disciples in the context of mission. First, He called them in Matthew 4:19, \u201cFollow me and I\u2019ll make you fishers of men.\u201d Then, He officially appointed them as His apostles in Matthew 10 and immediately unleashed them for an evangelistic campaign. Up until His final words to them in Acts 1:8, Jesus equipped His disciples with the core truths of the faith in the context of mission. By focusing on evangelism we are able to more effectively disciple teenagers because we add danger and risk to the scenario.\n\nYouth leaders play a key role in maintaining a youth ministry environment that emphasizes this philosophy and keeps THE Cause as the center of their strategy for spiritual growth in their teenagers. The \u201cDeep and Wide Youth Ministry\u201d strategy, along with the sharing of best practices from other youth leaders, is essential to helping them sustain this paradigm shifting model.\n\nShoud we focus on evangelism or discipleship in youth ministry? The answer is both/and not either/or.\n\nSource URL : http://www.christianpost.com/news/should-we-focus-on-evangelism-or-discipleship-in-youth-ministry-43024/"}

Cruz is no saint after the stunts he pulled in the latest fiasco-but the other side of the aisle needs to have their credit cards cut up.\n\nMassachusetts is being sold a load of goods on these casinos. Who is going to go there? New York State also has a ballot proposal this year to allow 7 casino licenses to be built across the state. It seems like all these states are cutting the casino pie into smaller and smaller slices, and the only ones who will win are the developers.\n\n\nBy kvn on\n\nIts the erosion of society , it started when the stores started opening on Sundays ,and the Mass Lottery with its Keno and scratch tickets on every corner , just throw the loser tickets on the ground . Just try to find a nice bake shop these days, with bread and pastries. Sheesh !\n\nWell, I don't know about that. What I do know is that all these communities are being told that they will rake in millions and bazillions of dollars in tax revenue, when those estimates are based on the (false) idea that there will be no other casinos in the area. There are only so many people who want to gamble, and every new casino that is built will split that money into smaller and smaller chunks. Besides, everyone will head to whichever casino is the newest, the biggest, the brightest, and the shiniest, leaving the older casinos in the dust.\n\nBy Stevil on\n\nThe people who will go to the casinos are often the same people that play the lottery - especially the money making slot machines. They only have so much money in their pockets to gamble with so if they play the slots - that's probably less they play in the lottery. While we may get some mitigation money from the Casino, some/a lot of that could be offset with reduced state aid. Of course, most people don't think of this or don't know how the system works so they think it's all extra money. For Eastie which is getting earmarked dollars - probably a good thing. For the rest of the city - who will still have to pay for a lot of this AND see decreased revenue from the state - not so good. One more reason this should be a citywide vote.\n\nBy mplo on\n\nOrdinarily I'd say that the cheapening of society is more like it, but I think that the erosion of our society and culture and their cheapening actually go hand in hand together; they're both happening at once.\n\nI don't think that stores starting to open on Sundays has had anything to do with the erosion and cheapening of our society, especially since, even before the Blue Laws were repealed here in the Bay State (which I'm glad they were!), stores in most other states were allowed to stay open on Sundays.\n\nThe fact that anybody could even consider having casinos here in the Boston area to supposedly create jobs, etc., however, does indicate how far our society and culture have fallen, and it's not good, at all.\n\nBy MC on\n\nThere is no provision anywhere in the Expanded Gaming Act or interpreting regulations which allows the applicant or the city to reschedule the vote on a whim. The Commission purposely designed this process so that it was up to the applicant to call the election (presumably when it felt that everything was in place and ready to go forward) and the fact that Suffolk Downs chose to build its application on quicksand really is not our problem. Even if the Secretary of State were to come back with some reasonable excuse to delay the vote, there is absolutely no realistic chance that a new partner could renegotiate the parts of the mitigation agreement previously applicable to Caesars, earn the trust of the neighborhood, and call an election before the licensing deadline of December 31. It's time for Suffolk Downs to fold 'em."}

This occurred in the 5200 block of Sycamore Avenue.\n\nThe suspect fled in cab No. 138. Police became involved in a high-speed chase with the suspect about 10 a.m. Friday.\n\nThe driver was spotted driving recklessly in south Kansas City along U.S. 71, police said. Officers began pursuing the man who pushed the cab's speed up to 100 mph, police said.\n\nChecker Cab GPS records show the cab's speeds reached 117 mph.\n\nThe chase eventually wound south and ended in Grandview after the cab crashed near U.S. 71 and Main Street. The chase lasted about 20 minutes.\n\nThe woman was seriously hurt but will survive. She is home from the hospital now and in good spirits, her boss said.\n\nThe woman said she tried to hit him with her stun gun during the attack, but was unsuccessful, according to court records.\n\n\"She stated that while the suspect was stabbing her, he was laughing and smiling and telling her, 'Get the (expletive) out of the car,'\" according to court documents.\n\n\"It's just not a good situation all the way around. It could have been worse,\" said Craig Bates, Checker Cab's owner.\n\nThe suspect apparently had been picked up at a Kansas City public library branch in the 600 block of Wilson Road. The man refused to pay and apparently repeatedly stabbed the woman in the face, arm and hand.\n\nJulian F. Rodriguez, who turned 20 earlier this month, was charged with first-degree robbery and armed criminal action.\n\nAccording to court documents, he confessed to every detail of the robbery and stabbing \"in a calm, matter-of-fact tone.\"\u00a0\n\nHe said he planned to take the taxi from the beginning.\n\n\"And although he thought it was wrong, he did not have negative feelings about it,\" according to court documents. \"He went on to state that he 'does bad things,' he tries to learn from the experience to understand how to get away with it better.\"\n\nHe said robbing and stabbing the woman \"was exhilarating to him,\" according to court documents.\n\nHe said he had sex in the taxi while at the Country Club Plaza and slept in the taxi, he allegedly claimed. The taxi company's GPS system helped officers located the vehicle.\n\nBates said attacks on taxi drivers are rare because the move to cash means that drivers carry little cash.\n\n\"We've transported more than a million people this year with our two companies and this is the only incident,\" Bates said. \"We almost made it through 2012.\"\n\nHe is considering adding cameras in the cabs for extra security, but privacy issues must be worked out.\n\n\nKCTV5's Alice Barr contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2012 KCTV (Meredith Corp.)

{"dataman_score": 4.0, "text": "Future Primitive: Kimbo Slice\u2019s Cruelest Cut\n\n[19 November 2008]\n\nBy Tobias Peterson\n\nLike Pussy Galore, Ebenezer Scrooge, or Fat Bastard, Kimbo Slice is among those whose name seems to give a particular insight into their personality. One need not be a Bond fan to know what Galore\u2019s game was. Similarly, Scrooge and Bastard were, as advertised, chintzy and overweight (respectively). As his own moniker suggests, Kimbo Slice has been best known for the violence he directs against those foolish enough to oppose him in a fight. Though it\u2019s hard to slice anything with a fist, many combatants have been taken apart by his abilities inside and, notably, outside the mixed martial arts cage.\n\nUnlike these other characters, though, Slice is a real person\u2014in some ways, at least. His actual name is Kevin Ferguson. His nom de guerre was given to him during a period in his life when he made ends meet as a backyard brawler. Often, this term is used to indicate an aggressive athlete who gives his or her all. In the case of Kimbo Slice, though, the description quite literally described his profession. Initially a standout high school football player in Miami, Ferguson was left homeless in the destructive wake of Hurricane Andrew. His college football prospects disappeared and he was forced to translate his skills as a linebacker into more immediately marketable commodities.\n\nAs a result, Slice became a driver and bodyguard for a porn company. After beating down several over-enthusiastic fans, his employer recognized his potential and put him to work as a combatant in illegal street fights. Slice and his handlers would show up at a designated meeting spot (often someone\u2019s house) and Kimbo would proceed to fight whoever had been arranged for him. Nearly always, he won, pummeling opponents until they could not (or would not) get up for further punishment. Money was exchanged. Slice\u2019s prowess was hailed. And, most importantly, video footage was recorded.\n\nKimbo Slice\u2014a large, heavily muscled black man sporting gold teeth, an unruly beard, and a fearsome scowl\u2014 embodied the stereotype of black physical menace so completely that there simply was no way that he could be anything but a Bad Man, one who invoked the clear threat (and thrilling promise) of violence at any moment.\n\nThanks to that camera, and the rise of YouTube, Slice became perhaps the first fighter to go viral. His fight videos earned him a devoted, underground following on the Internet, to the point where his ascension to the organized rules of Mixed Marital Arts competition represented the confirmation of his status as an ultimate badass. It wasn\u2019t that he was there to make a name for himself. In fact, when Slice first joined an MMA league (EliteXC), it was his name that was being used to garner notoriety, not the other way around. He arrived fully-formed, with a knock-out record and a back story that attracted fans and media alike. ESPN the Magazine, most notably, devoted a cover to Slice\u2019s menacing visage, well in advance of his televised debut as an MMA fighter.\n\nUnfortunately for Slice, and the many who sought to make money from his ascension to organized MMA, his first appearance as an EliteXC fighter on CBS was a far cry from those hand-held online documents of backyard dominance. Against a journeyman fighter named James Thompson, Slice absorbed a great deal of punishment (repeatedly trying to slow Thompson\u2019s elbows down with his forehead), before he managed with an overhead right to stun Thompson long enough for the referee to jump in and stop the fight. In his follow-up to this widely panned debut, Slice lasted 14 seconds before being knocked out by an unknown named Seth Petruzelli.\n\nIn the fallout from Slice\u2019s MMA incarnation, Petruzelli hinted in a radio interview that he was paid extra by league organizers to fight Slice standing up\u2014trading blows (which presumably would have favored Slice\u2019s strengths) rather than taking the match to the ground for a more manageable, less exciting wrestling match. The EliteXC has roundly denied the implication of a fix (and Petruzelli himself has issued a clarification), but it nonetheless was forced to file bankruptcy as the league\u2019s marquee star was eclipsed by ineptitude and scandal.\n\nClearly, Kimbo Slice was not the human wrecking machine that the league, CBS, and its advertisers had been banking on. As his own future remains uncertain, the rest of us are left to wonder just why he occasioned such lofty expectations in the first place. What inspired a budding promotional company to pin the entirety of its financial hopes on an untested fighter?\u00a0 How did an unproven slugger come to grace the front cover of a national sports magazine?\n\nThe answer to questions like these is at once straightforward and complex: race. Kimbo Slice\u2014a large, heavily muscled black man sporting gold teeth, an unruly beard, and a fearsome scowl\u2014 embodied the stereotype of black physical menace so completely that there simply was no way that he could be anything but a Bad Man, one who invoked the clear threat (and thrilling promise) of violence at any moment. Slice, whose fortunes were at once torn asunder and radically refigured by a hurricane, constituted a kind of perfect storm of racial stereotypes himself\u2014the combined effects of which ensured that, no matter how skilled a fighter, he was always already understood as someone to fear.\n\nConsider, for example, the way that Slice gained his notoriety. Though only a minor weapons charge mars his record, Slice\u2019s backyard brawling\u2014in unsanctioned bouts held without the organizing boundaries of a ring, an official, or commentators\u2014ensured that he would carry with him the criminal aura of \u201cthe streets\u201d, regardless of the arena in which he fought. Further, the seemingly spontaneous nature of these fights, as opposed to the contrivance of lights, cameras, and bikini clad ring girls, coded Slice as someone best understood as having a natural, in-born proclivity for violence. Ignoring Slice\u2019s training regimen (and a physique like his is impossible to achieve without one), the YouTube videos instead suggest that Slice was simply born to kick ass. We understand him as someone who shows up, throws down, gets paid, and goes home.\n\nOf course, that\u2019s exactly what he and all the other fighters are doing in an organized MMA bout. The only difference, other than the amount of people watching (including the ref), is the amount of money to be made. For his 14 seconds of consciousness against Seth Petruzelli, Slice reportedly earned half a million dollars. A sum like that evokes two conflicting reactions. On the one hand, it\u2019s rewarding to see a formerly destitute, self-described family man earn enough money to put his financial woes behind him. On the other, though, it serves as a sobering measurement of just how persistent and lucrative the presence of black stereotypes in sports remains.\n\nAs our enthusiasm grows for emerging new technologies that disseminate images and ideas at ever-increasing speeds, it would seem that our critical consideration of this influx continues to lag. As the case of Kimbo Slice points out, modern sports audiences still have a long way to go before they\u2019re free from the dubious legacy of centuries-old thinking.\n\nPublished at: http://www.popmatters.com/pm/column/65408-future-primitive-kimbo-slices-cruelest-cut/"}

J \u00a0There is a football game during Homecoming but its in a beautiful new stadium. The Homecoming parade still continues, but now it goes around the Ring Road instead of Main Street, St. Peter. \u00a0Plus there wasn\u2019t a ring road back then. DJ asked if the pledges were making the parade floats and the answer was\u2026\u201cno, that would be considered hazing and that\u2019s not allowed.\u201d \u00a0Hazing is requiring anything done by the pledges that the actives don\u2019t do. \u00a0Wow, would we be in trouble now!?!\n\nWhich brings a memory to Greg \u201cBenny\u201d Benson\u2026.\n\n\u201cHow could anyone forget Rush. \u00a0Of course, the OK\u2019s had the famous dung pool. \u00a0It was on the farm built to exacting standards with cow, horse, chicken, and pig dung, filled with water and stirred to the perfect consistency, and the size of a standard pool. \u00a0Each pledge walked the plank with a feminine napkin taped around their eyes, dove in and scrambled to the other side. \u00a0Then it was a long run down and into a cold late April lake. \u00a0This was the final task to become a member of the frat. \u00a0Of course, the painful weeks before were more challenging, the \u201chits\u201d with the paddle were the worst. \u00a0There was lots of fun stuff, too. \u00a0Singing in the cafeteria, getting all of the TM signatures with the pencil trick and one night I was blindfolded and taken out to Nicollet at 3:00 a.m. and had to dribble a basketball back to campus. \u00a0I still can\u2019t dribble! \u00a0Hard to believe it was 40 years ago, I could go back in a heartbeat!\u201d\n\nDonna Sjoding Amidon remembers some wild and wonderful frat parties like the one our sophomore year around Christmas when we sang all those fractured Christmas carols, it was hilarious! \u00a0(DJ thinks it may have been a sorority banquet. \u00a0Notice some of our memories don\u2019t match up with each other which makes these memories even more special!) \u00a0DJ remembers one Flea Banquet theme called Formosa Fun, TaiWan On! \u00a0And we surely can\u2019t forget all the sorority songs we learned. \u00a0I bet we could still sing all the verses of some, perhaps with a little prompting. \u00a0Benny recalls a frat party in Mankato when Judy Matalamaki was his date. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sure Judy remembers me carrying the \u201cbag\u201d across main street\u2026she was easy to carry. \u00a0The parties at Turner Hall in New Ulm were great, hard to believe we could even drive home (and then we told our kids not to drink and drive!)\u201d\n\nJudy Matalamaki Thiem still chuckles about a comment that Karen Alrick Jafvert made after the tornado changed Gustavus forever. \u00a0\u201cEveryone remembers those beautiful trees that were lost. \u00a0Karen asked \u201cDid we have trees at Gustavus? \u00a0All we were looking at were the boys walking down Hello walk!!\u201d \u00a0(DJ remembers walking down Hello Walk proudly wearing her GAC beanie that said \u201969!?!) \u00a0Judy continues..\u201cGustavus has changed in many significant and wonderful ways, but it brought a tear to my eye and a time I remember with such gratitude for the experience. \u00a0As my father put it so bluntly after seeing my grades, \u2018Judy, the ONLY responsibility you have is to study, and you can\u2019t even do that.\u2019 \u00a0What was he talking about?????\u201d\n\nThis from Sue McNamara Showalter\u2026.\u201cGustavus was life-changing for me. \u00a0I was the first person in my family to go to college\u2015and that was possible through scholarships and loans that I paid back after graduating\u2015my parents didn\u2019t even have a savings account! \u00a0I met the love my life there and I met some of the funniest, warm-hearted friends a person could have! \u00a0I had an absolute BLAST and would love to do it all over again. \u00a0Dave and I are having some of our ashes spread there, so that should change Gustavus in the future!\n\nOur Gustavus wedding is a fond memory. \u00a0We (Dave Showalter and Sue) were married December 20, 1968 in Christ Chapel by Rev. Elvee. \u00a0The Chapel was so beautiful, with many poinsettia plants cascading up to the altar. \u00a0Ma Young \u201933 catered the reception. \u00a0My bridal shower was held in Elvee\u2019s barn, with much laughter and singing along to Diana Ross and the Supremes and other great music of the day. \u00a0We were (and still are) so much in love with each other and with the college that brought us together. \u00a0After the wedding, we drove to Florida for our honeymoon. \u00a0We then settled in Dinkytown near the University of Minnesota, where Dave was attending architecture school and I began teaching mathematics at the old Mechanic Arts High School in St. Paul. \u00a0I had finished my coursework at Gustavus in 3.5 years, so I returned to graduate with my class in the spring. \u00a0Of course, we were also on campus many weekends to have fun with our friends!\u201d\n\nFollowing that marriage theme, Jim Kuitu says\u2026.\u201cI was lucky to meet my wife, Linda (Martinson \u201970) at Gustavus and we are still together!!\u201d\u00a0 Then he goes on, \u201cmaybe the hockey fan bus (well oiled) arriving at Braemar arena would bring some smiles. \u00a0Jerry Krieger \u201970, Pat McCuskey and me taping Coach Don Roberts \u201956 blades before practice\u2015he skated around and said his blades felt dull!!!\u201d\u00a0 Benny says he has fond memories of intramural sports\u2026\u201cthe frats were so competitive and we had great athletes, too bad some of them didn\u2019t play for Gustavus teams!\u201d\n\nMary Sue Hanson Taylor recalls emceeing the synchronized swim team\u2019s Follies at the pool, (now a social meeting spot called The Dive.) \u00a0\u201cI announced the finale, where the entire synchronized swim team slides into the pool in the pitch darkness, and then turns on the \u2018body lights\u2019 they have attached to their bodies, as they glide silently into their formations. \u00a0Elegant and dramatic.\u00a0 Only after the auditorium went dark for their entrance, I walked off the edge of the pool, fell in, and was silently struggling to get out. \u00a0I was sinking fast, dressed in my wool skirt and loafers, and seeing my predicament, the audio crew flipped on the house lights. \u00a0There I was, oops, sorry\u2026.me at one end flailing and the elegant swim team at the other\u2026.traumatized at seeing me in the pool. \u00a0We had to start over. \u00a0And we did, but the audience was laughing so hard it ruined the finale. \u00a0I forever apologize to the Synchronized Swim Team.\u201d\n\nDJ remembers being a charter member of the Gustavus bowling team. \u00a0\u201cAll physical education majors had to compete on some team, so this was mine. \u00a0We never had competitive teams for girls in high school, so I thought I\u2019d try bowling. \u00a0(Remember the new lanes on the lower level of the Union? \u00a0(Gone now.) \u00a0On my 21st birthday we had a bowling tournament in Ames, Iowa, so I was away for that weekend. \u00a0Darn! \u00a0No misbehaving on my part! \u00a0My aunt had taken cake decorating classes and sent a beautiful cake (so I heard) to the dorm. \u00a0But my dorm mates decided that it would go to waste because I was gone, so they ate the whole thing, never even taking a picture of it. \u00a0When I got back, my aunt asked how I liked the cake!?! \u00a0Otherwise I\u2019d have never known.\n\nHow many remember the different trips we took during winter break or with the college? \u00a0For most of us it was our first travel experience. \u00a0I will never forget my skiing experience in Aspen, Colorado, when John Denver joined us at Snowmass. \u00a0He sang in our hotel and then later in one of the Gustie\u2019s rooms at night. \u00a0Then he hitched a ride back to Gustavus with us on the bus. \u00a0Either Ann Martell \u201968 was with us or he wanted to get back to her in Minnesota. \u00a0He sang and played his tapes all the way home from Colorado. \u00a0It was glorious! \u00a0I still play his records, then tapes, now CDs. \u00a0Haven\u2019t made it to an iPod yet!\n\nDonna Sjoding Amidon continues...\u201cI remember being in the Gustavus concert choir and traveling to Scandinavia after my sophomore year. \u00a0It was such a fantastic experience for a small town girl. \u00a0I have many memories of our conductor, Phil Knautz \u201948, who demanded perfect continuous eye contact with him during a song when on stage. \u00a0Whenever my eyes started to drift I would feel this uncomfortable sensation and look at him staring at me with such intesity that I wanted to hide. \u00a0He demanded discipline and got it\u2026.I respected him for that.\u00a0 After graduating from Gustavus it seems that all our closest friends for life are Gusties and their families. \u00a0The friends we have kept the closest and longest all went to school with us or are best friends of our Gustie friends and therefore were brought into the circle. \u00a0That is not to say we never made other friends over the years but just that we have shared the most signigicant parts of our lives with Gusties. \u00a0In fact, we just came back from celebrating Christmas Eve with Maury Miller \u201967, Betsy Neprude Miller, and their daughter, Kristin \u201999 and her family.\u201d\n\nAnd here\u2019s \u201ca stream of consciousness list of events that jump into my mind\u201d\u2026by Mike Nielsen. \u00a0\u201cSome things mentioned will only be familiar to a handful of people, but still are my best memories of Gustavus. \u00a0Here goes\u2026my tough job of \u201cwatching the Student Union\u201d in the evenings, the unauthorized \u201cphone call scandal\u201d on my night shift, Powder puff football and the \u201cfear\u201d of Dar Gustavson (still his wife!), riding to Concordia for basketball in below zero weather, with no heat in the Gustie \u201cchecker limo,\u201d watching \u201cWillie\u201d trying to keep every athlete from stealing socks and tee shirts, getting my basketball trunks pulled down by the \u201cRat Pack\u201d under the basket at St. Johns, boxing in the Uhler basement instead of studying, intramural rivalries, judo class, molding a life-sized clay head of Greg Benson in sculpture class, watching water balloons slingshot out of top floor windows of Uhler Hall, the pigeons released in the library, hiding under the bed to escape the \u201cswat squad\u201d during Hell week. \u00a0The \u201cOK\u201d Hell Day and infamous swim, garlic toast at the Holiday House, the guys going to the Pizza Villa after the women\u2019s \u201cjustified curfew(!),\u201d the rumors of \u201ccontamination\u201d in pizzas made for rival frat members, finding recycled desserts in the cafeteria, Ma Young\u2019s eggs (and watching Benny methodically mince them up in \u00bc inch pieces every morning), the \u201cfarmhouse,\u201d townies, and frat parties, snow \u201cwhiteouts\u201d across the parking lot, and above all else\u2015the beauty of Christ Chapel!\u201d\n\nAnd from his wife, Darlene Gustavson Nielsen\u2026.\n\n\u201cMy first memory is my freshman year during parent's weekend\u2015Marilyn Anderson and I decided to hitchhike to Mankato. \u00a0Guess who picked us up\u2015my Mom and Dad and my brother. \u00a0They happily took us to Mankato, but I was mortified! \u00a0(OK, DJ hitchhiked from Mankato, too, but got picked up by a guy who gave her a lecture about hitchhiking, and she never did it again. \u00a0Did Dar?)\n\nDances in the Union. \u00a0Early morning swimming\u2015I was not happy that I had to take swimming since I already had my WSI and Toni D\u2019Angelo did not have to take it because she had her WSI. \u00a0Sorry Toni! \u00a0Mrs. Baker\u2019s decision! \u00a0(Comment from DJ\u2026Mrs. Baker did have her favorites and they did not include Dar or DJ!)\n\nKaren Alrick and I got to fly to Youngstown Ohio with the football team. \u00a0Coach Jocko Nelson \u201950 loved us!\u00a0 Karen and I were assigned to the \u201cCo-ed\u201d dorm as juniors\u2015we didn\u2019t unpack until we were changed to Valley View with all our friends. \u00a0And\u2026don\u2019t you love \u201cCo-ed\u201d\u2015girls on one side\u2015boys on the other with a gate in-between! \u00a0(Thanks, Dar! \u00a0I was one of your friends that stayed in Coed! \u00a0J DJ)\n\nLoved the ski trip to Aspen\u2015a small cowboy town with no paved streets! \u00a0Hard to believe! \u00a0We had hours! \u00a0The daughter of a friend of mine could not believe that the girls had hours but the boys didn\u2019t. \u00a0We loved it and made great friends. \u00a0I learned to play bridge! \u00a0I spent many hours playing bridge when I should have been studying.\n\nMike Nielsen and I got engaged on October 19, 1968. \u00a0He asked me to marry him in the cemetery in St. Peter and a \u201ccop\u201d found us and asked us to leave. \u00a0Great story! \u00a0(See above\u2026Mike never mentioned he met his wife at GAC??!!)\n\nAll the sorority and fraternity banquets\u2015driving back from New Ulm before people were actually picked up for DUI.\u00a0 I guess we should mention some academia\u2015my favorite class was comparative religion taught by Dr. Schneider. \u00a0(I agree, that was my favorite, too, and he was the best! \u00a0DJ) \u00a0There are so many more memories\u2015it was a fabulous four years!\u201d\n\nOnce you start reading these memories, others will likely start flooding into your brain, too!\u00a0 Did we ever go to classes?\u00a0 Or attend chapel?\n\nDo you remember what was happening beyond the hills of Gustavus in 1969? \u00a0(Other than the Viet Nam War which touched all of us at some point.) \u00a0Woodstock, Neil Armstrong walked on the moon, Paul McCartney denied rumors that he was dead, bell-bottom blue jeans, Sesame Street debut, the Mets won the World Series after being the worst team in baseball, and the following people were BORN: \u00a0Jennifer Aniston, Brett Favre, Steffi Graff, Renee Zellweger. L\n\nHere\u2019s who was born with us in 1947! J \u00a0Arnold Schwarznegger, David Letterman, Farrah Fawcett, Danielle Steele, Tom Clancy, Elton John, Carlos Santana, Polaroid Land cameras, Buffalo Bob and Howdy Doody, Spruce Goose, Minute Maid frozen juice. \u00a0\u201cIn the first televised White House address, President Truman asked Americans to refrain from eating meat on Tuesdays and poultry on Thursdays to help stockpile grain for starving people in Europe.\u201d\u00a0 (Could happen again soon!)\n\nWe are looking forward to reminiscing with more of you at our reunion next October. \u00a0Please put it on your calendar for Friday, the 9th, with your classmates, and Saturday, the 10th at Gustavus for the Homecoming festivities and more classmates.\n\nWritten amidst chuckles and tears, and sent to you with fond memories by your classmates,\n\nCousins, Benny and DJ\n\n1969 Guest Letter Writers\n\nCampus News\n\nHaugen Named Head Football Coach\n\n\nPresident Ohle is on the Road!\n\n\nMustaphi Named Michelle Obama\u2019s Deputy Press Secretary\n\n\nGustie Breakfasts\n\n\nGustie Pages\n\n\nUpcoming Alumni Events\n\n  \u2022 100th Anniversary of Gustavus Men's Basketball - Feb. 7\n  \u2022 Tucson Chapter Gathering - Feb. 19, Westward Look Resort\n  \u2022 Boston Chapter Gathering - March 14, Hyatt Regency Cambridge\n  \u2022 San Francisco Chapter Gathering - March 23, Hotel Vitale"}

A great blade option for 1U virtualization if you understand what you're doing.\n\nCons: You'll want to get a real raid controller since this server is barebones. But the fan housing is too close for normal SATA connectors on the backplane. I had to dremmel out notches in the plastic grill over the fans to get standard connectors to fit without smashing the wires. They expect you to have low profile which I never seem to have for SAS setups.\n\nOther Thoughts: Installed with xen 4.0 on debian 6.0 using Seagate constellation SAS drives via 3ware 9750-4i's and LVM. (define rootdelay=5 in grub to let the card initialize) But if you're going to do virtualization whether it be Xen, VMWare or whatever you need to understand that write caching for RAID configurations is extremely important. I don't know how many times I run into other IT guys who skimp on the card or don't understand what the battery backups are there for so they don't get it. Then they complain that its the hypervisor or the servers fault they don't know how RAID works or why write caching isn't enabled. Buy a real raid card just like you'd do from Dell, HP, whatever at an added price and also buy the cache battery / battery backup unit (BBU) so you can safely turn on write caching. (if you can be unsafe about it, depending on the card) If you do that you'll have a nice little 1U virtual server. Ours are running everything from windows 2k8 R2 HVM to RHEL and deb paravirt guests.\n\n\n  \u2022 N/A\n  \u2022 10/13/2011 7:47:40 AM\n  \u2022 Tech Level: High\n  \u2022 Ownership: 1 month to 1 year\n  \u2022 Verified Owner\n\n5 out of 5 eggsWorks with VMware ESXi 5.0\n\nPros: System works with VMware ESXi 5.0.\n\nCons: Removing existing SATA cables was a pain. Installed Adaptec RAID card and using the kit cable was a pain as well.\n\n\n  \u2022 Bart @ ASO\n  \u2022 9/26/2011 3:06:07 PM\n  \u2022 Tech Level: High\n  \u2022 Ownership: 1 week to 1 month\n\n5 out of 5 eggs\n\nPros: This barebone is wonderfully built from a brand you can always rely on. Our company paired a few of these with 2x Intel 5645 Hex Core processors (total of 12 physical cores and 12 hyperthreading cores), 24GB DDR3 UDIMM memory, and 4x1TB Western Digital RE4 drives in RAID-10.\n\n* Built in reliable IPMI\n* 1U Barebone that comes with heatsinks and rails\n* Quality parts\n* High wattage energy efficient power supply\n* Passive heatsinks cool these 6 core CPU's to about 40C idle\n\nCons: Can't say much about cons, because there aren't many. Here's a few minor ones.\n\n* It takes forever to post\n* SMTP alerts are flaky\n* Supermicro support is meh\n* No redundant power supplies (understandable for the price)\n\n\n  \u2022 N/A\n  \u2022 2/23/2011 3:44:28 PM\n  \u2022 Tech Level: Somewhat High\n  \u2022 Ownership: 1 week to 1 month\n\n4 out of 5 eggsNice server\n\nPros: nice features for the price, stable. love the built in impi managment. It's greate to be able to install a OS by bringingup the managment console on my laptop and using the virtual cdrom feature.\n\nInternal usb socket - great for installing vmware esxi onto a flash drive.\n\nCons: Onboard raid is softraid so it will not work in vmware esxi. Luckly the drives will show up as independant disk's in vmware and can be used that way.\n\nOther Thoughts: I wish someone had told me that if you only populate one of the 2 cpu sockets you will only be able to address 3 of the 6 memory slots. I purchased 6x4gb sticks and a single e6506 cpu and can only see 12gb of ram until I install a second cpu.\n\nthe onboard usb socket is a great way to install a internal flashdrive for esxi. Just make sure you get a really small thumbdrive.\n\n\n  \u2022 N/A\n  \u2022 6/18/2010 9:12:47 AM\n  \u2022 Tech Level: Somewhat High\n  \u2022 Ownership: less than 1 day\n  \u2022 Verified Owner\n\n4 out of 5 eggsGonna earn it...\n\nPros: Pretty small form with a lot of potential (dual CPU, 6 mem slots). You can end up with a pretty gutsy server for the price. I'll end up with a dual quad-core 24GB server - nice!\n\nCons: Wanted to run ESxi (and will do so) but lack of RAID support from ESXi was a surprise. Just because the BIOS allows you to \"enable\" Intel or Adaptec RAID, this is NOT the same as an above board hw solution (which ESXi requires).\n\nThe real killer? You need to load the RAID driver from a FLOPPY to use Win2003 - I have no idea how to do this because THERE IS NO FLOPPY in this server. Is this SuperMicros problem of Microsofts? Dunno, don't care, just annoyed...Google is my friend if I want to do this (or just go Win2008 I suppose).\n\nOther Thoughts: I will end up going with ESXi (it came right up and installed without a problem) even though RAID is not supported. Most of my woes here are lack of technical understanding around ESXi vs. BIOS RAID vs. using a floppy on server-style servers. Hopefully my thoughts here will help you prepare.\n\n\nICON Loading...\nOut of Stock\n  \u2022 $40.33 Shipping\nOut of Stock\nAre you an E-Blast Insider?\nSubscribe Newegg e-Blast\nHome\u00a0>\u00a0\nComputer Hardware\u00a0>\u00a0\nServers & Workstations\u00a0>\u00a0\nServer Barebones\u00a0>\u00a0\nSuperMicro\u00a0>\u00a0\nItem#:\u00a0N82E16816101314\nShop by Region: United States | Canada | China\n\nPolicy & Agreement | Privacy Policy\n"}

Florida State plays Auburn on Monday, Jan. 6, 2014. (AP Photo/Chris Carlson)\n\n\n\nBCS NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP: No. 1 FLORIDA STATE vs. No. 2 AUBURN, Rose Bowl, Monday at 5:30 p.m., ESPN:\n\nTop five things you should consider going into this final BCS title game but were afraid to Google it:\n\n= Florida State, at 13-0, leads the nation in scoring at 53.0 points per game, having put up a school-record 689 points in its 13 wins. The Seminoles are 28 points away from matching Oklahoma\u2019s 2008 NCAA record of 716 points. Auburn, at 12-1, is No. 9 nationally in scoring, averaging 40.2 points, with 522 total in going 12-1. Combine the two teams\u2019 point total \u2013 1,211 \u2013 and that\u2019s the exact number that USC and Texas had heading into their 2006 BCS classic title game.\n\n= If Auburn scores 30 or more in a game, it\u2019s practically a lock. They\u2019ve won 88 games in a row when scoring 30 or more. In its history, Auburn is 305-4 when breaking 30.\n\n= Florida State freshman quarterback Jameis Winston won the Heisman Trophy with a 190.1 pass efficiency rating, throwing for 3,820 yards and 38 touchdowns. Of those, 26 TDs and 2,579 yards came in the first half.\n\n= Auburn junior quarterback Nick Marshall, who less than two years ago was a reserve defensive back at Georgia and spent last season at a community college in Kansas, ran for 1,023 yards this season. Only two other SEC quarterbacks in history have run for more than 1,000 yards. One is former Auburn Heisman winner Cam Newton. Another is Texas A&M Heisman winner Johnny Manziel. In a 45-41 Auburn win over Texas A&M and Manziel this season, Marshall passed for 236 yards and ran for 100.\n\n= Auburn could be the first team to beat a No. 1 team twice in the same season, after knocking off Alabama 34-28 in November. The last time that came close to happening: Oklahoma, which tied No. 1 Texas (15-15) and beat No. 1 Nebraska (17-7) in 1984.\n\nGot it? Flip the coin and get on with it. Pasadena restaurants are staying open late for your enjoyment.\n\n\nNBA: LAKERS at CLIPPERS, Staples Center, Friday at 7:30 p.m., ESPN, TWC SportsNet, Prime:\n\nNo Kobe? Check. No Chris Paul? Checkmate. So does that seem to even things out a bit when Round 2 of this annual series takes place under the covered up Lakers championship banners (since it\u2019s a Clipper home den)? Maybe it depends if Pau Gasol is around to see this one play out. Go back to that stunning result on opening night \u2013 Xavier Henry scores a career-high 22 points, Jordan Farmer adds 16 and the Lakers get 76 points from their bench in a 13-point win to spoil Doc Rivers\u2019 debut as the Clippers coach. With Henry and Farmer among the injured, we\u2019re not sure who the Lakers even have on their bench healthy enough to suit up.\n\nAlso this week\n\nLakers at Dallas, Tuesday at 5:30 p.m., TWC SportsNet\n\nLakers at Houston, Wednesday at 5 p.m., TWC SportsNet\n\nClippers vs. Orlando, Staples Center, Monday at 7:30 p.m, Prime\n\nClippers vs. Boston, Staples Center, Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., Prime\n\n\nUCLA vs. ARIZONA, Pauley Pavilion, Thursday at 6 p.m., ESPN:\n\nThe Wildcats, 15-0 and ranked No. 1 in the nation for the last month, are the best thing going in the Pac-12 at this point. Why would the Bruins or Trojans feel a need to disrupt the attention that Sean Miller\u2019s team had built so far? When these two met last in the semifinals of the Pac-12 Tournament in Vegas, UCLA pulled out a 66-64 come-from-behind win.\n\nAlso this week\n\nUSC vs. Arizona, Galen Center, Sunday at 6 p.m., Pac-12 Network\n\nUCLA vs. Arizona State, Pauley Pavilion, Sunday at 7 p.m., ESPNU\n\nUSC vs. Arizona State, Galen Center, Thursday at 7 p.m., Pac-12 Network\n\n\nKINGS vs. BOSTON, Staples Center, Thursday at 7:30 p.m., FSW:\n\nThe Kings and Atlantic Division-leading Bruins go into this week as the only two teams that have given up less than 90 goals this season. Boston, with Finnish goalie Tuukka Rask, is second in the NHL with 2.1 goals-against per game average, behind the Kings\u2019 league-best 2.0.\n\nAlso this week\n\nKings vs. Minnesota, Staples Center, Tuesday at 7:30 p.m., FSW\n\nKings vs. Detroit, Staples Center, Saturday at 7:30 p.m., FSW\n\n\nHALL OF FAME ANNOUNCEMENT, Wednesday at 9 a.m., MLB Network:\n\nThe veterans committee has already decided that managers Joe Torre, Bobby Cox and Tony La Russa are in for this summer\u2019s induction. So who\u2019s with \u2018em? Thirty-six are eligible, including first-timers Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine, Frank Thomas and Jeff Kent. So are former Paul Lo Duca, Hideo Nomo and Eric Gagne, but let\u2019s not spoil the suspense.\n\n\n\nINDIANAPOLIS at NEW ENGLAND, Saturday at 5 p.m, Channel 2\n\nSAN DIEGO at DENVER, Sunday at 1:30 p.m., Channel 2:\n\nIt\u2019s Chargers-Broncos III. Each has won on the other\u2019s home field during the regular season. \u201cThree times in one year, I\u2019ve done that couple times in my career, it\u2019s the worst,\u201d said CBS analyst Phil Simms.\n\n\nNEW ORLEANS at SEATTLE, Saturday at 1:30 p.m., Channel 11\n\nGREEN BAY/SAN FRANCISCO at CAROLINA, Sunday at 10 a.m., Channel 11:\n\nThe Seahawks\u2019 34-7 win over the Saints on a Monday night in early December saw Russell Wilson complete 22 of 30 passes and finish with a quarterback rating of 139.6. He is 14-0 at home in the regular season. Drew Brees was just 23-of-38 passing for 147 yards against a depleted Seahawks\u2019 secondary.\n\nFigure skating\n\nU.S. FIGURE SKATING CHAMPIONSHIPS at Boston, women\u2019s final, Saturday at 8 p.m. (delayed), Channel 4:\n\nU.S. ladies champ Ashley Wagner is back to defend her title, four years after missing a trip to the Vancouver Olympics. The 22-year-old is a favorite take one of the three open Olympic spots. On the men\u2019s side, after Evan Lysacek passed on a comeback attempt, there are two spots open for Max Aaron, Jeremy Abbott, Ross Miner or Adam Rippon. May the best be seen next month in Sochi.\n\nAbout the Author"}

High, committed to UF on Friday, a day before the Gators\u2019 humiliating 34-17 loss to Vanderbilt in Gainesville. That dropped UF to 4-5 on the season with three games remaining at South Carolina, and at home against Georgia Southern and Florida State.\n\nUF will have to win two of those games to become bowl eligible.\n\nGoolsby talked about his son during a blustery, 27-degree day in Derby, which is just outside Wichita. Obviously the Florida weather was a nice attraction for DeAndre, but the dad also said reassurances that things would get better from UF recruiter Derek Lewis, the Gators\u2019 tight ends coach, made things more comforting.\n\nPhotos: Sports Illustrated swimsuit models\n\n\u201cDeAndre kinda looked at that \u2026 \u00a0but when you start looking at the injuries and how they were already going in young at the skill positions and stuff like that \u2026 it didn\u2019t really bother him,\u201d said the father, who played fullback at Kansas State in the mid-90s. \u201cHe knows what\u2019s coming back, as far as skill guys, and once you get people healthy, it will probably be a different story.\u201d\n\nThe young Goolsby, who doesn\u2019t do many interviews, is a highly touted flex tight end with good speed and hands. His numbers are pretty good despite playing in a run-oriented offense at Derby High. He\u2019s rated as the No. 3 tight end in the country by, and the No. 15 tight end in the 247Sports composite rankings.\u00a0 He has 27 catches for 400 yards this season.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, he\u2019s hearing stuff every day about how people aren\u2019t going to survive and all that and it doesn\u2019t help when you\u2019ve just made your decision,\u201d Goolsby said, \u201cbut the coaching staff at Florida let us know early that with injuries and all ... this stuff was going to start happening and to not worry about it. They were confident in him and he\u2019s confident in them, so it was kind of a match made.\u201d\n\nDeAndre Goolsby said during his announcement Friday, \"Right now, their record doesn't really bother me, because I know we'll go in there and change some things around.\"\u00a0\n\nPlenty of schools will be tugging at the 6-foot-5, 225-pound tight end between now and National Signing Day. He picked Florida over Kansas State, Arkansas and Ohio State, and those schools are not likely to let up.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s 100 percent, but he\u2019s still getting calls every day and he\u2019s turning people down, telling them he\u2019s 100 percent with Florida,\u201d said Dad. \u201cOnly way he wouldn\u2019t be is if something drastic happened, like if they let the whole staff go. I think that would be the only thing that would deter him from going down there.\u201d\n\nDeAndre is also a January enrollee, so his decision-making process has been somewhat expedited. He had to make sure his decision was solid since he\u2019ll be packing his bags in a little more than a month to head to Gainesville.\n\n\u201cTell his mom,\u201d the dad laughed. \u201cShe cries about it every morning.\u201d\n\nThe former K-Stater said he didn\u2019t try to sway his son to play for his former coach, Bill Snyder.\n\n\u201cWhen I was coming up, I always told myself I would never tell my kid where to go \u2026 only thing I\u2019d do was help him and that\u2019s pretty much what I\u2019ve done,\u201d said Goolsby, an all-state running back in his day at Dodge City High. \u201cDeAndre\u2019s pretty quiet. He\u2019s got all this stuff going on with people knowing who he is, but he sits back and really analyzes everything. I knew once he felt good with a situation, he\u2019s \u00a0kinda stubborn that way, so he was stuck on it. Whatever choice he made, I felt good about it.\n\n\u201cIt was a special time for him, but also a hectic time. We\u2019re just glad it\u2019s over.\u201d\n\nGoolsby is the second athletic, flex-type tight end in the Gators 2014 class, joining C'yontai Lewis (6-5, 215) of Kingwood Christian School in Alabaster, Ala. UF has 15 commitments in the 2014 group.\n\n"}

Since he brought up a lot of great points I asked him to write an guest article so all of you can benefit form his experience and wisdom. Here he goes\u2026\n\nBruce Lee\n\nBruce Lee\n\nFor two years now I have practiced a very effective branch of self defense system called WingChun (also known through the movie IP Man and Bruce Lee).\u00a0Around the same time I started training WingChun I also met the Lord and got radically touched by Holy Spirit. Quickly I realized how both elements were transforming me into an other man. Spiritual growth on one hand and physical exercise on the other. I since have experienced that the path to physical discipline and becoming a strong fighter presents many parallels to our spiritual growth.\n\nMy Grand Master Klaus Brand taught me 12 rules of WingChun. 7 of these I deem not only valid for fighting and self-defense, but also for life and spirituality in general. Here we go:\n\n\n1. If You Think You Are Weak, You Are\n\nThe real battle always happens in our minds. If you think that you can\u2019t do anything, you can\u2019t! It is all about your attitude. Never allow negative thoughts to takeover your daily behavior and therefore your destiny.The person who thinks they can and the person who thinks they can\u2019t are both right.\n\n2. Believe in Yourself and Trust Your Teacher\n\nTo grow in God we need both \u2013 a humble longing to constantly learn from Him and a solid, confident identity. Always make sure to keep balance between these two.\n\n3. Always Keep Improving Your Technical Knowledge and Your Physical and Mental Flexibility\n\nWhat ever it is you do and whatever you\u2019re called to \u2013 never stop improving. Fighters study theory, but also know that they won\u2019t grow without practical implementation. The same should be true for us. How many things has God revealed to you that you haven\u2019t acted on yet? How often do you wish you grow in spiritual areas, yet you barely exercise the gifts He\u2019s given you? Lay down the book and begin the training.\n\n5. Never Let Yourself be Influenced by the Movements of Your Opponent and Never Yield\n\nDon\u2019t allow negative circumstances and influences to alter your course. Stay focused on your God-given goal and never give up.\n\n6. To Fight You Must Have Continual Tension. Relaxed Muscles Are Useless in Combat\n\nLive your life under a positive tension. You can move and change the world. It\u2019s important to relax, but something in your should always be aware of the importance of your calling and your responsibility to represent His kingdom on earth. Don\u2019t be a fighter without fire.\n\n7. Protect Yourself by Destroying Attacks\n\nbruce lee destroying attacksWhen in a fight it\u2019s always better to \u201cdestroy\u201d an attack instead of only dodging it. There are techniques which allow you to redirect the opponents momentum and use it to your advantage. Before you can defend yourself against an attack you need to predict where it will be coming form. In the same way in our spiritual lives, we shouldn\u2019t only wait for temptations or spiritual attacks to happen, but learn the patterns of how and where the devil tries to come at us. Once you\u2019ve identified his techniques (wrong beliefs, lies, negative thoughts, bad relationships\u2026) you can intentionally begin to destroy them by applying the word of God to these exact situations.\n\nYour Turn:\n\nDo you think there are some valuable spiritual lessons hidden in Martial Arts? Which one spoke the most to you? Le\u2019t me know your\u00a0thoughts, inspirations and feedback in the comments below. I love to hear your feedback!\n\n\nRelated Posts Plugin for WordPress, Blogger...\nAbout Tilman Griesel\n\nTilman Griesel is a 24 years old software developer, creative and innovator based in Stuttgart, Germany. He is a core developer at dozeo.com and works on mobile applications for believers.\n\n  \u2022 wayne davies\n\n    This is such a great article, though i don\u2019t practice martial arts anymore i was watching a Jet Li film fierce the other night and was comparing life with and without Jesus and how this mirror\u2019d in the film, basically God just hit me with a light bulb moment after watching it about being disciplined and being a disciple, about how this helps as we move through our walk with him and that this is never about us but just all about him.\n\n    Keep up the great work.\n\n    \u2022 http://www.revivallifestyle.com/ Daniel Vogler\n\n      I agree, it\u2019s a great post by my friend Till!\n\n  \u2022 SistaMeds\n\n    #5 definitely spoke to me. Oftentimes you can get stuck spinning you wheels defending yourself against attacks. The key is to remember the battle is the Lord\u2019s! Pray I will remember this instead of responding in my flesh. Lord help!\n\n    \u2022 http://www.revivallifestyle.com/ Daniel Vogler\n\n      True story XD"}

We take excellent care of all 4 of them. My husband is a retired Dentist and we still have a home in Greensboro, NC but spend 99% of our time now at our beach home in North Myrtle Beach. We love it here! We have 8 grandchildren! We also have 2 yorkies, Hope and Grace. My husband and I grew up in Ohio and both graduated from Ohio State University and then he attended dental school at OSU. (Go Bucks!) We own a personal beach home near just a block from all 4 of our properties. We really looked up and down the coast before deciding on this area of North Myrtle Beach. One reason we loved this section called Crescent Beach is the beach is very wide and beautiful. It is never crowded and very family and pet friendly. You are allowed to use golf carts in this area to drive all over. You are also allowed to ride bikes on the beach. We are close to everything. Parks, Golf Courses, Fine Restaurants, Fantastic Shopping, Tennis Courts, Amusement Parks, Water Sports, Beach Shops, Shows and Entertainment, Marina's, Inlets to the Ocean, Gambling Boats, Deep Sea Fishing etc....It is a great location!I\n\nShelley Kraska purchased this house in 2006\n\nWhy Shelley Kraska chose Crescent Beach\n\nWe have been coming to North Myrtle Beach for over 25 years. We love this area. It has beautiful beaches and it is very relaxing. If you want to go out for dinner or shopping or to a show it is close to everything. We own a personal beach home just a block away.\n\nWhat makes this house unique\n\nI provide 8-10 beach chairs and 12 beach towels. There are sand toys, boogie boards, etc... in a container. I also provide baby items such as a full size crib, crib sheets, mattress pad, packnplays, a packnplay mattress, high chair, booster seat, infant swing, infant bouncer seat, infant bath tub, exersaucer, stroller, baby gates, bed rails, etc...hs internet service as well as hd cable boxes in each living area. There are of course flat screen tv's and dvd players in each bedroom. I think we strive to make your vacation as relaxing as possible! Please let us know if there is a special request and we will do our best to accommodate you! We do pick up beach wheel chairs for our guests and return them.\n\nGuestbook comments from the owner\n\nWe had a wonderful family get together at PP1. Our 3 kids and their spouses and children all stayed together in this incredible beach home. We had a wonderful time. There was plenty of space for all of us and there were 15 of us. We had 3 children under the age of 2 and Shelly provided everything we needed for the babies.Our 5 grandchildren loved the private pool and riding to the beach on the golf carts to the beach. The beach was just down the street and it is so wide and never crowded at all. We cooked out on the gas grill and enjoyed the large fully stocked kitchens. There were pancake griddles and a waffle maker. We had everything we needed to prepare large meals. Since there are 2 kitchens it made meal preparation so much easier. It gave us some space so we were not crowded ever. We loved that we had 2 laundry rooms too! The pool and deck area are very nice as well as the large front porches with the rocking chairs. We were close to lots of nice restaurants and the shopping was fantastic. We were close to the Tanger Outlets and they are so nice with all the shops anyone could want. We saw the pirate show with the grandchildren and they loved it. We also went to the amusement park on the beach at Main Street. It is so nice and the kids wanted to return every night. It was very close to the house. The house is beautiful and so nicely decorated. It was cleaner than my own home. I don't know how they keep it so clean. We loved arriving to all clean beds and having the beach chairs and towels was so helpful. There were also lots of sand toys and boogie boards for our use. I know we will definitely be back!\nAug 2012\n  \u2022 1 of 2\n\nWhy HomeAway\n\nBedrooms 8\nProperty type house\nMinimum Stay 7 nights\nBook with confidence\nBook with confidence\nGuaranteed, secure, with no booking fees\nAdd vacation protection services to your booking\nThree services to protect your trip:\nProtect your payments in case you need to cancel.\nGuarantee the rental meets your expectations\nEnsure you're prepared in case of accidental damage.\n\n\nbased on 26 traveler reviews\n\nWrite a Review\naverage rating of 5.0 based on 28 reviews\nGlasgow KY\n\n\n  \u2022 5 of 5\n\nThis place was amazing!

The house was very well-maintained, had very comfortable beds and linens, a well-stocked kitchen and plenty of linens for bathroom and pool/beach. The heated pool was a nice addition to our trip, since the early April weather was unpredictable. We were able to swim 3-4 times, despite the cooler temps! It was so much fun for my two teenage boys! My husband and I enjoyed walking our dog to the beach every morning. It is a very close/easy walk. The family really enjoyed using the golf carts and the all the beach chairs for our afternoons at the beach. It is very obvious the owner has taken a lot of time thinking about what the renters will need.

You are allowed to drive them all over this area. Thanks you again for the outstanding review. Sincerely, Shelley and Jan Kraska\n\nWe loved it and had a great time.\n\n  \u2022 5 of 5\n\nWe loved our trip, the house was perfect. It was much bigger than we thought and was very well stocked.

We appreciate your effort writing the review.\n\nGreat Vacation Home!\n\n  \u2022 5 of 5\n\nWe recently enjoyed a long weekend stay from Nov. 7th - 11th, 2014. We wanted to thank you Shelley and Jan for allowing us to rent your beautiful home! It was spacious, very clean, beds were comfortable, and very well stocked with dishes, cookware, utensils, towels, etc., which is hard to find sometimes in a rental. Most places provide just the bare minimum of supplies. But not your place!!! It had all we needed for cooking and sharing meals together around the spacious table. The two things we liked best was 1. Being able to bring our small dogs. This was especially important and very much appreciated because 2 weeks before our trip our 4 legged \"baby\" was diagnosed with Mast Cell Cancer and had to have surgery to remove it. We just recently took him to a Cancer Vet specialist so to be able to take him along with us was priceless! He enjoyed riding the golf cart so much and would run to the door when we asked him if he wanted to \"go for a ride\" which is the 2nd thing we loved most! Our entire family along with the doggies loved going on our family golf cart rides! Another plus on this trip was that my 70 and 74 year old parents who both have back and neck problems got to enjoy soaking in the Jacuzzi tub in the master bedroom for their 1st time ever. They both said it helped relax the muscles in their backs. We all hope to be able to enjoy this house or another of your rentals in the near future. So from my parents, my husband, kids, and doggies WE THANK YOU ! Hope to return again soon!\n\n  \u2022 Submitted: Nov 18, 2014\n  \u2022 Stayed: Nov 2014\n  \u2022 Source: HomeAway\nOwner's Response: We always appreciate it when our guests and their pets have a great stay at one of our properties. We try to make your stay as comfortable as possible. Our 8 bedroom beach home PP1 is great for families with elderly parents because they do not need to use the stairs and we provide 2 golf carts for driving to the beach even though the beach is very close to the house. We allow our guests to bring their dogs which is wonderful because most dogs do not like to be left at home and many get very anxious when boarded. Our own dogs are getting very old and we hate to board them. We try to take them with us whenever we can. We strive to excellent care of our 4 properties. If there is anything that needs our attention we take care of it immediately.\n\n\nCar: recommended\n\nPP1 is located on 16th Ave. South in North Myrtle Beach. This area is also called Crescent Beach. Our beach house is very close to PP1. We love this area because it is very family freindly and you can ride bikes on the beach anytime of the day. We love that golf carts are allowed to be driven all over our beach area,to the grocery, parks, tennis courts, shops, restaurants, etc...We have 2 golf carts for our guests that rent PP1. The beaches are pet friendly. We are close to the inlets to the ocean which is great because we have a boat. You can rent a boat, go deep sea fishing, go out on a dinner cruise or one of the gambling boats, etc...because we are close to all the marina's and inlets to the ocean. We are very close to the nicest restaurants, shopping areas, golf courses, shows and attractions, parks, and the best and widest beaches in the area. Our beach access is never crowded and very wide with beautiful white sand. You love this area as much as we do! I am sure of it!\n\nOther Activities: We love to go to oue favorite pizza place right at the end of 16th ave. across the street. It is Benitos wood fired pizzeria with great Italian food and pizza. During the summer you must go to the main street carnival and ride the ferris wheel overlooking the ocean. Our grandchildren love to go and we have a great time always. For a drink by the sea or a great burger there is Molly Darcy's at the end of 17th Ave. South on the Ocean. There is a deck overlooking the Ocean which is great for a beer or sandwich. Mr. G's ice cream and hotdog shop is also on 17th Ave. South across from the Beach Shop where you can pick up anything you might need. You can drive the golf carts to any of these places. There is a very nice park across 17 directly behind Krispy Cream which is also close to PP1 for hot doughnuts anytime of the day. We are close to all the attractions, shopping, restaurants, golfing, fishing, water sports (also on the beach at 17th Ave. South).\n\nGolf: There are numerous golf courses near the house in North Myrtle Beach. There are 2 right across the street at the end of 16th Ave. South one is Beech Wood and the other is Possum Trott. There are really so many excellent courses in this area! It is a golfers dream come true! I would recommend just do a search for golf courses in the Myrtle Beach Area. We are just a mile from the Myrtle Beach area. North Myrtle Beach and Myrtle Beach are one in the same really. North Myrtle Beach is a very family friendly area with all the beach homes and golf carts etc...\n\nSki: We are not a ski resort so this does not apply but I can give additional information about other activities in this area. We have been to all the shows. The new pirate show is great but I would make reservations asap. We are very close to Bare Foot Landing which has tons of shops and restaurants. Broadway at the beach was fashioned after Bare Foot Landing. The House of Blues is great for teens and college age children with all the bands etc...We are close to the Tanger Outlets which are awesome. They are very nice and I would definately recommend them. Main Street is fun to walk around. It is very close and known for the Shag clubs for dancing and the open air pavillon where you can dance under the stars next to our beautiful beach. It is the Shag Capital of the World. You can buy shag shoes in the shops and take Shag lessons. The ice cream shop the Sugar Shack on Main St. has excellent flavors of ice cream and highly recommended. Have a great time in North Myrtle Beach!\n\n\nRates & Availability\n\nFrom $2,995 Per week\n\nCrescent Beach House Rental Rates\n\nRental Basis:\nper property\nRental rates quoted in:\nConvert Currency\nRate Period Nightly Weekend Night Weekly Monthly Event\nAug. 29th-Sept. 5th 2015\nAug 30 2015 - Sep 5 2015\n7 night minimum stay\nSummer 2016\nJun 4 2016 - Aug 20 2016\n7 night minimum stay\n\nAdditional information about rental rates\n\nProperty Damage Protection $59\nPet Fee $70\nTax Rate 12.0%\nNotes $1600-$5500.\nPlease do not send any payments without first calling me.

I think you mean rogue.\n\nLarryK4 said...\n\nThanks. Corrected.\n\nMy Prof did tell me a few weeks back that I could use a Copy Editor.\n\nTom said...\n\nA very good job of giving reasonable prognostications in a field that is notoriously hard to predict.\n\nIt is true that it's hard for citizen journalists to catch all the typos and errors when you are the only one editing. It's only natural to become blinded to your own copy since you become so familiar with it you see only what it should say, not what it actually does say. Fortunately such mistakes are usually very short lived because some helpful reader is bound to point them out.\n\nHowever publications produced by a staff should not gloat too much about the advantage they have in this regard. Considering the fact that all their copy passes the eyes of several professional writers before it goes to press, it makes it remarkable that even the New York Times has a daily correction box.\n\nFrankly, most bloggers do a damn good job of editing considering they do it all themselves. What's the New York Times excuse for errors even after their copy passes through multiple editors?\n\nOne of the many reasons why internet writing is superior to print is that if a mistake does sneak through online, it is easy to quickly correct it so that all future readers read it right. In print, your mistakes are forever stained on the paper.\n\nTell that professor the score is still Internet - 1 Mainstream - 0\n\nTom said...\nThis comment has been removed by the author.\nLarryK4 said...\n\nThanks Tommy.\n\nMr Prof is actually a BIG fan of all things Internet (after all, she teaches this course online).\n\nI suspect she is also a big fan of Citizen Journalism.\n\nAnonymous said...\n\nIs she a big fan of using copyrighted photos without permission?\n\nLarryK4 said...\n\nWell I found it on Google images so I figured it was fair game (\"fair use\" and all that).\n\nEven Mr. Murdoch does not mind a small sampling of his vast media empire available for free on the web.\n\nAnonymous said...\n\nThe nostradamus of Amherst ... more delusions of grandeur.\n\nLarryK4 said...\n\nActually it was a required academic assignment.\n\nAnd my Prof would probably point out that Nostradamus is capitalized.\n\nSpock said...\n\nSen-sors indicate that Larry Kelley's blog has become com-pletely ~irrelevant~.\n\nAnonymous said...\nThis comment has been removed by a blog administrator.\nAnonymous said...\n\nYou really are a world-class bullsh*tter.\n\nYou swiped it just like a kid illegally downloading music. And, just like the kid, you laugh and say \"What's the harm?\"\n\nThat's called copyright infringement.\n\nBecause something is indexed on Google Images does not give you any right to use it. But you are lazy so you just swiped. Note that no copyright notice is displayed on your part.\n\nFair use is a completely different issue, and your use is not covered by it. If you are so sure that Mr. Murdoch would grant you use then you should ask him through his licensing department.\n\nOf course, it wouldn't matter because this picture isn't owned by Murdoch. It's owned by Paramount Pictures which is a subsidiary of Viacom.\n\nBut then again, you're lazy or you would know that.\n\nLarryK4 said...\n\nWell I also noted their was no copywrite notice on Google's part. And they have a tad more money than me.\n\nSo if Paramount Pictures gets in a tizzy they will go after them first.\n\nAnonymous said...\n\nDo you shoplift on the same basis? It's only a candy bar?\n\nNow you are making excuses.\n\nGoogle is a search engine. This photo wasn't on Google. This photo was on a website that google linked to. It has nothing to do with Google. And you are making excuses for stealing it that they will prosecute someone else first.\n\nSo much for integrity.\n\nLarryK4 said...\n\nSince it is sooooo important to you, and you can't find anything else to bitch about...\n\nAnonymous said...\n\nIt's obvious that stealing is not important to you, unless someone else is doing it.\n\nLarryK4 said...\n\nAnd a picture is worth a 1,000 words.\n\ncapt kirk said...\n\nThe first thing that needs to be understood is that every photograph is the intellectual property of the person who took the photograph. Copyright protection attaches even where the person has not put a copyright notice and even if the copyright is not registered with the Copyright Office. (You do, however, need to register with the Copyright Office in order to sue on your rights.)\n\nEvery copyright holder has certain exclusive rights that attach to their work. These include the right to reproduce, distribute, display and create derivative works from the work (there are others that don\u2019t apply to photography). Without permission, even if you were to give credit to the copyright holder, you would still be infringing their work.\n\nAs far as my liability for you loading the copyrighted of the work onto my computer and uploading it from there, I could be subjected to vicarious liability for my part (or, more accurately, my computer\u2019s part) in the copyright infringement.\n\nIf you were to contact the photographer and ask for permission to use the photo, you then would not be violating the rights of the photographer provided you abide by whatever terms the two of you agree to.\n\nLarryK4 said...\n\nAbout 95% of the photos I use on this blog are ones I take. And many of them end up in Google images as well. And my sitemeter tells me they get used all the time.\n\nSo while I on very rare occasion borrow from the Well of Knowledge, at least I also contribute more than I receive.\n\nEd said...\n\nLarry, you are neglecting the consequences of (a) the worsening fiscal emergency and (b) the related social uprising.\n\nMy guess - newspapers will come back as the political advocacy organs that they once were.\n\nLarryK4 said...\n\nI honestly hope they do. I love newspapers.\n\nAnonymous said...\n\n\nIf Larry cared, he'd be covering it.\n\nAnonymous said...\n\nLarry, your argument that you \"steal\" less than is \"stolen\" from you is faulty.\n\nJournalists are trained to have the intergrity to know that one of their functions is to educate. Thus the importance that was placed on grammar, spelling, plagarism....\n\nYour response appears to indicate that you think a different interpretation of copyright law applies to your blog or maybe all blogs and/or internet writing.\n\nCould you clarify?\n\nHarry T.\n\nTom said...\n\nLarry why are you bothering to argue with these people? They really don't give a shit about copyrights, it's just a distraction so they don't have to argue about the real points you raise. I suggest you respond to such people like I do:\n\n\nAnonymous said...\n\n\nIt seems to me that your whole point has been that Citizen Journalism is legitimate and should be taken seriously. Well, then Citizen Journalists have to take it seriously too. They have to respect copyright law and not plagiarize material or illegally use copyrighted photos, videos or text. This places a burden on them, because they don\u2019t the have dollars to pay to access copyrighted material legally. However, they also don\u2019t have the expenses that major media have either. The newspapers and magazines, whether online or on paper, pay to use copyrighted photos. Something to think about for your next class.\n\nLarryK4 said...\n\nYeah, good point Tommy.\n\nI'm sure IF \"Harry T.\" has a blog it is perfect (perhaps he can afford to hire a Copy Editor.)\n\nBut then, if he had a blog he probably would not be bothering me.\n\nTom said...\n\nSeriously, if someone doesn't want their photos copied it is easy to prevent it, either by asking Google to remove it (they will gladly do so) or encoding the photo itself so it cannot be copied and a message appears to the effect \"You are not authorized to copy this photo.\"\n\nBut very few photographs have those restrictions on them because their owners WANT them to be copied. What they gain in publicity and exposure far surpasses in value the few pennies they would get in payment for charging someone to use it. Instead they are delighted to have their image (their brand) endlessly copied and reproduced as a wonderful form of advertising they could never afford to pay for.\n\nAs for copying words, the rules are identical to those of the print world. So-called \"fair use\" allows you to use a reasonable sampling - usually not more than two or three paragraphs - to illustrate how it relates to what you are writing about and why someone should read the whole thing. You are then expected to follow it with a link and a phrase to the effect \"To read the rest click here.\"\n\nBut even these rules get fuzzy online. Many people, especially those who are advocating a particular opinion, will welcome you copying as much as you want. When the New York Times tried to put its columnists behind a paywall they rebelled, demanding that they be available for free, and the Times backed down. The columnists didn't want to miss out on the media invitations, book deals and increase in their own fame that comes from being copied and distributed all over the internet.\n\nThe phrase used on the internet to describe this phenomenon is \"Content wants to be free.\" At least by those who intend to make money, giving it away is the best way to rake it in.\n\nAnonymous said...\n\nI loved your giving more than taking argument. I'd love to see that one in court.\n\n\"Sure I stole the car your honor, but look at how many cars I've bought in the past.\"\n\nIt doesn't wash.\n\nI hope you aren't teaching your children that just a little bit of stealing is alright?\n\nTom said...\n\nSee what I mean Larry? Just headfuckers. Ignore 'em.\n\nAnonymous said...\n\nThis guy publishes his papers on online journalism and then laughs off his own copyright infringement. What a maroon.\n\nLarryK4 said...\n\nI believe it is spelled moron you Cowardly, Anon, Nitwit.\n\nAnonymous said...\n\nThe comma goes inside the quotation marks in your title. Also, if you have quotes within a quote, you use ' not \".\n\n\"'The sun will come out tomorrow,' and 5 years hence\"\n\nLarryK4 said...\n\nThanks. You're hired.\n\nAnonymous said...\n\nBugs Bunny\n\n\"What a maroon!\"\n\nLarryK4 said...\n\nGosh, I hope that did not violate copyright of Warner Bros Cartoon division.\n\nAnonymous said...\n\nThat one's old enough that it's public domain. Know your copyright law.\n\nLarryK4 said...\n\nThat's why I have you.\n\nAnonymous said...\n\nYou do seem to bear a strong resemblance to Elmer Fudd.\n\nLarryK4 said...\n\nAt least that's not a copyright infringement.\n\nBeats resembling an Anon.\n\nAnonymous said...\n\nAs long as Larry acknowledges his sources and isn't\nusing others' material for his own commercial purposes, his free-use shouldn't run afoul of copyright principles.\n\nBut if Larry and his fellow-travelers really want to make progress, consider adopting the \"copyleft\"\nprinciples used by many programmers and other\ntechnically-oriented \"intellectuals\" (see:\n\n\nfor example).\n\n-Your Friend\n\nAnonymous said...\n\nAnonymous said...\n\n...please where can I buy a unicorn?\n\nAnonymous said...\n\n(They don't care?

It will allow educators and parents to work closer together to provide the best education possible for the students,\u201d said Howell, who noted other recommendations of the audit will also be addressed. \u00a0\n\nHowell is making the completion of Corridor H and a four-lane upgrade to U.S.\u2008Route 220 as a top priority.\n\n\u201cAn increase in the amount of bonds the state is permitted to issue for highway construction is being discussed,\u201d said Howell. \u201cI'm hoping recommendations of a WVU report from a number of years ago on highway construction will be part of the discussion.\u201d\n\nDuring a December meeting, the Mineral County Development Authority requested that legislators forgive the debt on the Fort Ashby Business and Technology Park and to promote it at the\u2008West Virginia Development Office.\n\n\u00a0\u201cThis issue exists in almost every industrial park in the state,\u201d said Delegate\u2008Robert Schadler during the meeting. \u201cIt\u2019s not just this one shell building. It\u2019s going to take a broader effort. I know that Mineral County would love the state to forgive their loans.\u2008We are talking 800,000 bucks \u2014 that\u2019s a lot of money \u2014 and if you multiply that by 40, now you are talking real dollars.\u201d\n\n\u00a0Rick Linthicum, authority president, noted that the authority can\u2019t defer the cost of the park and they would be willing to pay it back.\n\n\u201cThe unintended consequences, in my opinion, was the building was built before we had somebody that needed it,\u201d said Linthicum. \u201cWe need pressure on the (state) Development Office to know where Mineral County is, especially Fort Ashby. Most big corporations do not want to talk to the authority; they want to talk to the state\u2008Development Office.\u201d\n\nThe park is under the control of the authority and not the state, said Howell. He believes that the recent appointment of new members to the authority will make a big difference.\n\n\u201c(County) Commissioner Jerry Whisner has already been in contact with me on ideas and requesting information on what resources are available from the state,\u201d said Howell in an email. \u201cI stand ready to assist in any way possible to help bring jobs to Mineral County and will continue to push pro-job growth legislation in Charleston.\u201d\n\nThere are a total of 70 acres at the park and 63 are left, according to Mona Ridder, executive director of the authority.\n\nThe legislative session will open Wednesday but will recess until Feb. 13 in order to give the newly elected governor a chance to prepare his budget and get his staff in order, Howell said.\n\nHowell has planned two Town Hall meetings. The first will be held Jan. 22 at 6 p.m. in the Mineral County Courthouse. The second will be Jan. 29 at 6 p.m. at Greater Cumberland Regional Airport in Wiley Ford. \u201cThese are being held to hear the ideas of the citizens that I represent, because some of the best ideas come from the people,\u201d Howell said.\n\nContact Elaine Blaisdell at\n\nText Only\nLocal News\nMust Read\nNews related video"}

Users have observed and reported a serious issue with the HTC One\u2019s capacitive buttons, which makes it difficult to get the desired results when you press on the home and back virtual buttons.\n\n    XDA Developers member\u00a0m03sizlak posted a collection of observations, which indicates that the issue is not an isolated case. Even customer service representatives from the Sprint store where he bought his HTC One say it\u2019s a known issue, which is present even on the demo units at the store.\n\n    Symptoms appear to be sporadic, and users observe the problem to be an inconsistent detection of button-presses. Other users believe the detection area is actually too small, and you would have to be very accurate in touching the glass to get the desired result. As such, you might keep on pressing Home or Back, but the HTC One will not respond in most cases.\n\n    Fortunately, a fix is in sight, although HTC has only started rolling out an OTA update to unbranded devices across Europe and Asia, which means users from the US who bought the HTC One from carriers are likely to experience some delay before getting the update.\n\n    The \u201c\u2033 update (where \u201cxxx\u201d is your country code) actually brings a few improvements on top of the \u201cvirtual button sensitivity\u201d adjustment, which includes camera adjustments, improved Beats Audio experience and improved bluetooth device matching. If you have an unlocked or non-carrier branded device, then you can try updating through\u00a0Settings / About / Software Update / Check Now. Otherwise, you might have to wait until the update is rolled out for your carrier.\n\n    Should this be a deal-breaker for prospective HTC One buyers? Might this force you to go for a Samsung Galaxy S4 or other device, instead? If you\u2019re considering either of these flagship devices, you can check out our HTC One vs. Samsung Galaxy S4 by-the-numbers comparison. Or, you can check out our Samsung Galaxy S4 vs. HTC One video comparison.\n\n    Like this post? Share it!\n\n\n    \u2022 mjolnirxz\n\n      No piece of hardware comes perfect out of the box, and this includes iphones and galaxies.\n\n      \u2022 apploholics\n\n        Yes, but this is HTC, who has always ignored factory defects. There is no fix to this problem and never will be, but dont take my word for it, learn the hard way like i did, you guys will soon find out why HTC fell from being number one to become the most hated android manufacturer.\n\n        \u2022 Garry DeWitt\n\n          Given that the touch panel is one whole piece (including the area where the buttons are), and the screen isn\u2019t having any issues, I would infer that is a software issue. Furthermore the update posted in the article seems to contain a fix.\n\n          > learn the hard way like i did\n\n          Well lets see, so far they\u2019ve released improvements for the camera and button sensitivity, that\u2019s two points. In the opposite direction I\u2019ve heard reports of unusual gaps in the zerogap construction from the speaker grills to the plastic area. I don\u2019t have this but others have posted pics of it. they\u2019re less than 1mm (maybe .3?), so I\u2019m guessing HTC is just saying that it\u2019s in acceptable error margin, probably to help supply. So that can be a point against them.\n\n          2/3 is not terrible, though to be fair the issues they\u2019ve fixed are software (meaning the idea of calling it a hardware defect is silly)\n\n        \u2022 mjolnirxz\n\n          obvious troll is obvious, the OTA 1.29 has fixed the issue already, as reported by members on XDA. The only question that remains is when it would be pushed out to the US customers due to carrier obstruction and inefficiency\n\n        \u2022 ardain\n\n          I think you\u2019re going too extreme. :D\n          I also hate HTC, but I don\u2019t think this issue will make they falling to bottom of list, lol.\n          And I heard it\u2019s already fixed, so not really big deal.\n\n    \u2022 Travis\n\n      as long as the update fixes the issue, i\u2019m not going to consider it a negative on the phone.\n\n      \u2022 fixxmyhead\n\n        what about when it takes months for the update especially in the US?\n\n        \u2022 amine ELouakil\n\n          exchange your phone for a new one? duh.\n\n      \u2022 quietly defective\n\n        There is no fix, this is HTC remember? When did they ever fix factory defects?\n\n        \u2022 juye\n\n          My ONE just fixed in the midst of reading this article, many jump the gun too fast and too sure. But too bad the result is not the way they wanted to be. Problem fixed. Only 30 minutes ago fixed mine. I think many HTC hater must be very disappointed. Too bad for them, wait for next chance.\n\n    \u2022 dandroid13\n\n      HTCfail lol\n\n    \u2022 Richard Young\n\n      I\u2019ve had this problem with my HTC One. No way is it a deal breaker. Best piece of technology I\u2019ve ever used.\n\n    \u2022 Alu Zeros\n\n      Let me know if anybody else notice this, if you keep volume at n just one bump up about no sound,after a while it will turn up automatically up. Also this is with put phone in bag vol feature off. Happens with phone facing up or down and not in pocket.\n\n    \u2022 chocho\n\n      this is a deal breaker for me if no fix. I love my current S3 but I love that One\u2019s design. if no fix i will wait for HTC TWO lol\n\n      \u2022 chocho\n\n        oh and I think maybe there\u2019s no fix for current batch, But maybe they will secretly include it in their next batch\n\n      \u2022 mjolnirxz\n\n        there is a fix, this article is obviously biased because 1.29 fixes the issue.\n\n    \u2022 Garry DeWitt\n\n      I flashed an INT rom on the first day (which was using the leaked base that would become the update they speak of in the article) and haven\u2019t had much problems. I will say that the trigger area is small. I first thought I was having a sensitivity problem, but then after I pressed and it didn\u2019t happen I would look at where my thumb was. Sure enough it was just a little off where the actual home button was. Pressing the actually button worked. It\u2019s been 3 days and I\u2019ve gotten used to the size of the button, no problems now.\n\n    \u2022 mozz\n\n      This is so typical of HTC and one of the reasons i stopped buying their products. They always seem to have common problems that should be rectified in testing.\n\n    \u2022 jetuo\n\n      Hi my HTC ONE having this button problem since day one and I have tried all methods suggested, such as recalibrate sense sensitivity, but problem still there. One the half way reading this article, I did check update, found update and updated. Then guess what, BINGO, problem disappeared.\n      the update change the blink feed page style too. Now its has a drop down menu to choose which news site you wand to read.\n      But one point I want to bring up here, we do have real problem with buttons, and article is also about this problem, many users brought up this issue. But someone said need to press precisely or should press this way or that way or sound like other don\u2019t know how to use. Users nowadays have great experience of smart phone and how it should be, and report real problem. So say something sound like not a problem just like users don\u2019t know how to use it. That is really annoying.\n\n    \u2022 isamu\n\n      I had the same problem with my htc one try this worked wonders for me no longer have this problem\n      go into settings, language keyboard, htc sence input, advanced, calibration tool press the highlited circles on keyboard until it shows complete then see if it has made any difference for you :)\n\n    \u2022 isamu\n\n\n    Stay Connected\n\n"}

Because in fashion and style I am the head cornerstone.\n\nNaturally, spirt and truth shines a light that grabs at personal being senses. The ultimate goal is a connection of a divine like nature, imaginative or realistic. A Lion of Judah must conquer.\n\nForeign influences always excite the homebody's enlightenment as an explorer can travel with natural fiber textiles that are plant based in preference and pattern.\n\nOutdoors, remind you of durability how will my outfit float in stripes of chevrons. The inspiration is tribal but the designer must be ethnic with her retro style architecture. The prints should be down to earth with meaning. Or else it will fall.\n\nRespect the culture with appreciation then style and fashion will follow.\n\n\n\n  \u2022 Python devours crocodile\n    Python eats crocodile after gruesome five-hour battle\n    Strange News\n  \u2022 Paris Fashion Week\n    Fashion trends: The best looks from the Chanel shopping center runway\n    10 Photos\n  \u2022 Gun dealers plead guilty\n    Connecticut gun dealers plead guilty to federal firearms violations\n    Guilty Plea\n  \u2022 Legal marijuana business license\n    Washington state issues first legal-marijuana business license\n    Business Buzz\n  \u2022 Skin cancer\n    UCLA researchers slow the spread of creeping skin cancer cells\n    Health News\n  \u2022 Home births on the rise\n    Parenting: Home births among white women are on the rise\n    Home Births\n\nUser login\n\nLog in\nWrite for us"}

I got my 4th piercing on my earlobe around the end of May 2012, and I think I may have created another hole next to the actual piercing. The piercing is probably around 90% healed; the front hole is healed and never bleeds, but the back hole (where the earring comes out of) is still healing and sometimes will bleed a tiny bit. I've been cleaning my piercing with salt water and anti bacterial soap, I have not used any creams or lotions on it, it does not hurt or ache and there is no pus. However, I think I may have poked another hole at the back of my ear when I pushed the earring back through the hole after I took it out to clean it. So now, I think I have one front hole, and two holes in the back. The earring can go through the front and out the back in two separate holes, and the two back holes are not connected. Something might have ripped on the inside of the piercing. I'm trying to close one of the holes, and the skin on the new one has already formed over but the area around it looks a bit red. Should I continue to clean it as I have been doing? Or should I get it checked out?<br /><br />Any information would be helpful, thanks!</p> </blockquote> <p>Hi there,</p> <p>Your description is good, but I'm still not going to be able to offer thorough advice without seeing you, or at least a clear, close up photo or two.<br /><br />Are you wearing <a href=\"\" title=\"Quality Body Jewelry from Body Circle Designs\">body jewelry</a> or a traditional earring?

{"dataman_score": 4.0, "text": "\ufeff Last Week with the HP OfficeJet Pro 8600 - TechProbe\n\nLast Week with the HP OfficeJet Pro 8600\n\nSo, this was my final week assessing the Hewlett-Packard Officejet Pro 8600.\n\nThis printer has been a good all-round product. Right from the set-up, which was very easy, the printer has performed well. A printer that does not require constant attention is a good printer.\n\nThe 8600 is also a very feature-rich printer. With printing, scanning and copying, the functions are well thought out, and as simple as possible to use.\n\nThe \"scan to network folder or PC\" is a breeze. \"Scan to memory stick\" is simple, and printing from a memory stick is really easy. You can also select multiple pictures to print, as well as being able to decide how many to print per page. And, all this can be done from the printer's touch display. In fact, to print things, you don't really need a computer, at all.\n\nThe 8600's sheet feeder works well for scanning. When scanning individual items, these can still be collated as one file, which is a good feature.\n\nThe ePrint functionality is also very useful when wanting to print direct from a mobile phone. This function was very easy to set up, both on the printer and on the phone. The remote printing works very well, ie, sending an item to print via email. The only thing, we wonder, is why you would want to do this. The other puzzling feature is the ability to print dinner recipes and news items from the internet, directly from the printer's display, without having to use a computer.\n\nThis is an ideal multi-function printer for the small or medium enterprise. It easily rivals the functionality of some of the larger multi-function devices, bringing the same power to a small business, at a lower cost, which is a good thing. Now there is no reason not to produce quality documents. The one thing, we would say, is to use good-quality paper for promotional material. Perhaps 100gsm paper, especially if printing anything that has a lot of block colours, as the amount of ink required could wrinkle thinner paper.\n\nUsing a mix of phones, PCs and different operating systems, there has not been any instances of not being able to print. The provision of Linux drivers gets a big tick from us.\n\nOverall, we at Proaxiom would rate the Officejet Pro 8600 a nine out of 10. We have marked it down by one point because of:\n\n  \u2022 Lack of a hinge damper on the lid\n\n  \u2022 No place to manually feed paper\n\n  \u2022 Lack of a bit of a handle for lifting the lid.\n\nOn the plus side, the 8600:\n\n  \u2022 Is quiet\n\n  \u2022 Produces high-quality print\n\n  \u2022 Is speedy, including first page print time\n\n  \u2022 Is easy to set up\n\n  \u2022 Is easy to use\n\n  \u2022 Has numerous options for printing and scanning\n\n  \u2022 Is energy efficient.\n\nWe were expecting a quality product, as it was from HP; and we were right.\n\nA highly recommended multi-function printer.\n\nPrevious Story\n\nVerdict of the HP Officejet Pro 8600\n\nSponsored Links\n\nRecently Viewed Products"}

If they want to eliminate one day of mail delivery per week, why not eliminate Mondays? There are already six Mondays a year when there is no mail delivery because of Monday holidays. If Saturday delivery is eliminated, there will be at least six times a year when there are four days between mail deliveries. And it could be more if any holidays fall on a Friday. If package deliveries and post office operations are continued on Saturdays, how much are the real savings. None of those occur on Monday holidays anyhow, so the savings would be greater by eliminating Monday deliveries.\n    6 Feb 2013, 05:03 PM Reply Like\n  \u2022 mikeurl\n    , contributor\n    Comments (421) | Send Message\n    Even more ridiculous is that there isn't even a real problem.

{"dataman_score": 4.0, "text": "Dirty Dreamer \u2013 Missy Pink\u2019s Sex Advice\n\nMissy Pinks at MrPinks.comDear Missy Pink,\n\nI guess I should begin by saying I\u2019m a 35 year old woman, never married and not a professional at relationships period. I\u2019ve always been very shy and to be honest, I was in my late 20\u2019s before losing my virginity. I reached puberty early in life and have always had a high sex drive, but, have always used masturbation as my release. The problem with that, the fantasies I would come up with. I have a wild imagination and as the years went on, it took extreme things to really have me satisfied, even with high powered sex toys involved.\u00a0 Now that I am having more dates and being more active, I\u2019m not finding myself as turned on by the men in my bed as I can get from my own imagination, have I ruined myself?\n\nDirty Dreamer\n\nDear Dirty,\n\nThere\u2019s nothing written in stone as to what is a suitable or acceptable age for losing your virginity, some are earlier in life than others, but thank goodness, we always are in possession of the box our cherry came from! If the world were open and honest about taboo topics, we\u2019d probably find the majority of the population experienced their first orgasm by their own hands, and even if they find themselves in a steady relationship, marriage, whatever the case may be, there\u2019s still something familiar, comfortable and exciting about stealing those private moments of masturbation, it\u2019s like cumming home to an old friend.\n\nIt sounds as if even though your saturation was solo generated, it was done for a very long time, and I\u2019m guessing frequently, so, you achieved a routine and not just an orgasm. No one knows their body like themselves, but, when you\u2019re in the right relationship, the exploration and training sessions can be extremely stimulating. You didn\u2019t say if your dates of late have been more of the one night stand type, or those where you\u2019re building on something\u00a0 a bit more long term, but, if you are seeing someone on a steady basis, explain to them you bloomed a bit later in life with your shared lust and you need someone to take the time to make you feel like a woman, even in the presence of a man.\n\nIf a guy truly wants to be in a relationship with you, he\u2019ll not just see it as a challenge, but also as a portal into a deeper connection, both physically and emotionally. Share some of your taboo fantasies, while sharing pillow talk during foreplay, explain in detail the things that would turn you on like the switch of your vibrator, he\u2019ll become more aroused and so will you by feeling as if you\u2019re \u201cliving out\u201d your dirty dreams. It could turn into a win/win sexual situation.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind, when you close your eyes, you can be anywhere you want to be, you\u2019re not bound to the bed you\u2019re sharing with your lover, or by yourself for that matter. It\u2019s okay to fantasize even when you\u2019re with someone, that\u2019s all a part of human nature, just because your sexual interludes now include a partner doesn\u2019t mean you have to shut down the erogenous zone of your brain, the two can go hand in hand nicely. Be yourself, be wild, and be honest, and if he can\u2019t handle your physical needs for orgasm, then maybe he\u2019s not the man for you, but luckily, as the saying goes, there are plenty of fish in the sea, so toss your rod back in the water and see if you pull back a keeper. After all, with your practice, you\u2019re already a \u201cmaster-baiter!\u201d Hang a sign on your door that says, \u201cGone Fishin\u2019\u201d and then head for the watering hole!\n\nThis entry was posted in Missy's Sex Advice, Sex, Sex Tips and tagged , , .

{"dataman_score": 4.0, "text": "Thursday, March 10, 2011\n\n....It's like Riding a Bike\n\nUnfortunately, I've always been a bad bike rider. I dunno, when I was a kid I could ride a bike okay, I was never one for tricks or stunts. I enjoyed the basics, the feel of rushing through the air, my legs pumping to pick up speed, the freedom a bike gives a kid.\n\nAs an adult, well, bike riding takes too much focus. Its work. Insulated by youth, I never really worried about the cars around me when I was a child. Now, I'm constantly aware of the speeding vehicles and my own lack of skill on a two-wheeler. It takes all my concentration to remain balanced. The seat is uncomfortable and bike riding hurts my back (I fell down a flight of stairs in college and add childbirth to it, my back isn't the best).\n\nSo where am I going with this besides the observation that I should be kept away from anything with the word \"Schwinn\" on it? Writing works the same way for me. If you asked me to ride a bike from point \"A\" to point \"B\" I could do it. It would be ugly and I wouldn't enjoy it, but I could make it. If I did this everyday, I would get better. My balance would improve. I'd find a way to ride where my back wasn't achy. Eventually I'd go further and enjoy it.\n\nOnce you learn to ride a bike, the basics of it are pretty programmed in. You don't forget. For me writing is the same way. Tell me to write something and I can do it. I can get to point \"A\" to point \"B.\" It might be ugly and I may not like it. But it would get done. If I write everyday, I will get better and would eventually start to enjoy it again.\n\nFor me, its getting the motivation to even try. How much do I really want to do this? Why do I want to start writing again? Is it worth the effort? I think I have to remember the rush of when I was writing everyday and working on a project. I have to remember the wild abandon I felt putting words together. I have to go back and recapture the feelings I felt much like when I was a kid riding a bike.\n\nLike anything worth accomplishing, it takes practice. It takes work and it isn't always fun. As Susan and Toni its going to take some writing garbage first. And I think the blogging helps. I do believe the writing will come back and be as good or better than ever. Sadly, I don't think the same can be said for bike riding. Think I will stick to my car.\n\n1 comment:\n\nSusan Helene Gottfried said...\n\nbabe, have you SEEN gas prices lately?\n\nGet on that bike."}

The Bread Mona Lisa Mosaic measured 29 feet wide and 35 feet long and was constructed using 10,080 pieces of bread. Oh, the sandwiches that could have been.\n\nThe Bread Mona Lisa Mosaic was made using plain bread, toasted bread and my personal favorite, bread with dark and milk chocolate poured on top of it. The mosaic was built for the Japanese television show Morisanchu, a show featuring a comedic trio of women. While I have never caught an episode of the show, I am interested in seeing it now, as we share a common love of bread with chocolate on it."}

But how much exactly?\n\nAre these so-called accomplishments the long overdue entitlements to the rural areas? Are these KPI (Key Performance Index) on rural infrastructure what has been promised by so many BN prime ministers for so long? Have the rural folk who have waited for decades finally been given what the BN rural representatives have promised every elections without fail \u2013 ever since 1957!\n\nOn closer scrutiny of the statistical data, it is clear that only a very small number of the rural population are benefitting from the GTP. Malaysia has a rural population estimated at eight million people or two million rural households.\n\n\n\n\nElectricity was delivered to even less households \u2013 27,000. Finally, only 780km of roads were constructed.\n\nThe truth is that the rural development record of the government in the GTP is no better than its past woeful record which saw our rural people neglected and impoverished so that many had no choice but to migrate to the urban areas to find a decent living.\n\n\u2018Shameful record of under-achievement\u2019\n\nThe GTP is a shameful record of under-achievement, mismanagement, failure to deliver the goods and empty promises. A few rural constituencies where by-elections were held during the past two years where the government was forced to provide roads and other infrastructure so as to bribe voters have benefitted. A very small number of favoured rural households of BN supporters have also benefitted.\n\nIn contrast, the vast majority of the over two million rural households have got nothing from the GTP.\n\n\nThe same pack of lies is being told to the average Malaysian on the other five NKRAs (National Key Result Areas). Has the urban transportation system really improved under the GTP? The best people to answer this question are the commuters caught in countless hours of waiting in queues in the cities and urban areas.\n\n\nRather ask the average Malaysian who has to pay coffee money for everything and who is fully aware of how high-level corruption continues to flourish under BN rule.\n\n\nThe government and the GTP drafting team may have their statistical fairy tales but few believe or have any confidence in what the BN spin masters are pushing out. Prime Minister Najib Tun Razak and his back room boys and consultants massaging the GTP may believe like Goebbels, the Nazi propaganda chief, that if they repeat a lie long enough, it becomes truth.\n\n\nFormer cabinet minister Chua Jui Meng is now Johor PKR leader. - FMT\n\nNo comments:\n\nPost a Comment"}

Some horses have natural balance in the gait-- but Capataz does not! But he longer bolts when he loses his balance and we're finally working up to going straight along the long side of the arena. But you won't see canter in this vid, I know it needs a lot of work.\n\nOur trot and walk still need work too. More impulsion from him, more steadiness from me. I'm still re-training myself to ask my aids correctly (upper calf, instead of the ankle) and I'm incredibly right-sided (I have some trouble keeping my left leg directly under me but working on it!). Going to the right in trot is always visibly easier.\n\nI've been taught now to use side-reins (and my coach watches me lunge for a bit before every lesson, to continue giving me lunging advice) and he's been working so hard! His trot is beautiful on the lunge, and he reaches very well underneath himself. It's been harder getting that same reaction under saddle going to the left, he really doesn't want to engage that left hind, but I know he can, I see it on the lunge!\n\nAnyways, I'm ready. I know I have lots to do and what I have to do, but I always enjoy a fresh pair of eyes!\n\nFlipper 01-29-2013 06:26 PM\n\nThe two main things I notice is firstly, that you have a tendency to lean backwards with your upper body which causes you to develop a chair seat at times. Secondly, that yours reins appear to be very long so that when he is reaching into the contact you are fine , though his neck is still a bit too stretched out I would say, but the minute he comes above the contact you have little control.\n\nHope this helps!\n\ndisastercupcake 02-01-2013 11:42 AM\n\nI agree with Flipper. You have a tendency to get behind the vertical, which is when your horse raises his head and evades the bit.\n\nOther than that, you look okay. Sometimes your rein looks a little slack. Consistent contact will encourage your horse to be 'on the bit' more :)\n\n\nPowered by vBulletin\u00ae Version 3.8.5\nCopyright \u00a92000 - 2014, Jelsoft Enterprises Ltd.\nSearch Engine Friendly URLs by vBSEO 3.6.0"}

Probably not; but (according to the November 18 edition of the New England Journal of Medicine) they were four times as likely to die of accidental overdoses of opioid medication prescribed by doctors to treat pain. Indeed, in the state of Washington, death from overdose of medication is now the leading cause of accidental death, exceeding road traffic accidents.\u00a0 Moreover, it seems that the legal prescription of pain killers has introduced abuse of opioids into rural areas where it hardly existed before.\n\nIn Oklahoma, for example, methadone (the drug most commonly used as a substitute for morphine or heroin in the treatment of addicts, and also used as an analgesic) was implicated in the deaths of 21 people between 1994 and 1996; but between 2004 and 2006 it was implicated in the deaths of 377 people. (I take the figures from the October 2010 edition of the American Journal of Preventive Medicine.) The figures in the same state in the same years for hydrocodone were 9 and 220, for oxycodone 1 and 220, and for fentanyl 2 and 78, respectively. It seems that abuse of such drugs on a large scale is now happening, and diversion on to the black market also.\n\nMost deaths associated with opioid analgesics occur when the person is taking other drugs as well, notably benzodiazepine anxiolytics (drugs like valium). Either doctors continue to prescribe combinations of drugs known to be dangerous, or patients consult different doctors and deceive them as to what they are already taking (or, of course, they resort to the black, or open, market).\n\nIt might be argued that the 11,499 deaths in the U.S. caused by opioid drugs in 2007 (mainly of people between the ages of 35 and 54) were a small price to pay for the increase in pain relief that such drugs give. After all, four million Americans receive such a drug in the course of a year; only slightly more than a quarter of one per cent of them die as a result. All benefits have risks attached; in any case, is a doctor his patient\u2019s keeper?\n\nClick here to view the 94 legacy comments\n\nComments are closed."}

It is a fair bet that issues of net neutrality will be very important as we progress as a nation. In addition, the odds are good that other countries will adopt similar ideals to those in the US.\n\nWe must have a balance in our policies which allow service providers to make as much money as they can without interfering with competition. We need service providers to be strong, invest in new technologies and help us compete as a nation. We also need to draw strong lines in the sand so service providers will know how far they can go without crossing over into areas that they shouldn't.\n\n\nBut then again, perhaps the biggest issue is that of transparency. If a service provider decides to take liberties such as slowing a customer's internet connection, shouldn't customers be informed along the way?\n\nLikewise, some service providers will boot subscribers off their networks or put limits on their future browsing speeds if they exceed certain limits.\n\nWhile it is nice for service providers to protect the integrity of their networks, who are they to arbitrarily do these things without telling their customers.\n\nIf service providers will engage in practices such as shutting off customers who go over certain limits it is incumbent upon the FCC in my opinion to force these providers to set up a web dashboard where users can see how close they are to going over their allotted download amounts.\n\nPerhaps a three strikes and you're out policy makes sense here.\n\nIn other words, service providers have a power over customers which seems awfully arbitrary and customers have shown they are not fans of this sort of behavior.

However, it was not until the September workshop that a proposal was fleshed out and a time frame presented.\n\nTo support take up of the programme, the government is considering a number of incentives, including low-cost loans to consumers to fund solar panel installation, which could then be paid back using earnings from electricity generation.\n\nAccording to the minister, the feed-in scheme would be complemented by the development of smart-grid infrastructure, which uses digital technology to help balance supply and demand using two-way communication, improving efficiency and reducing energy consumption. A smart-grid system can, for example, advise consumers to lower their consumption at peak-demand times. The minister added that since this would be a major investment, private sector participation was a possibility.\n\nGreater use of renewables could cut carbon footprint\n\nA study conducted by the World Bank shows that, on a per capita basis, Brunei Darussalam is one of the top electricity consumers globally, ranked seventh behind Iceland, Trinidad and Tobago, Qatar, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain. The Sultanate also has one of the broadest per capita carbon footprints outside the Gulf region, with emissions per person amounting to almost 21 tonnes, according to the US Energy Information Administration.\n\nMost of Brunei Darussalam\u2019s electricity is produced by gas-fired power stations, though there is some use of diesel generators in rural regions, mainly as a back up to the central grid. The only renewable facility is the 1.2-MW Tenaga Suria Brunei solar plant in Seria, commissioned in May 2011, representing around 1% of installed capacity. The minister of energy told local press in August 2012 that the plant is \u201ca small but important first step in the development of renewable energy sources\u201d.\n\nThe Sultanate has set a target of 10% of electricity production from renewable sources by 2035. Other countries in the region, however, are aiming much higher. Thailand\u2019s Alternative Energy Development Plan 2011-21 targets 25% renewable energy and 2000 MW of solar power capacity. A number of projects have already come on-line in Thailand, bringing its installed solar capacity to well over 100 MW.\n\nIn Malaysia, a US-based firm, SunEdison, announced in July that it is investing RM170m ($39m) to build two solar plants, with a combined capacity of 15 MW, while the government there is aiming for 1250 MW of renewable power capacity by 2020. Meanwhile, ASEAN, of which Brunei Darussalam is a member, has committed to 15% renewable energy by 2015, a deadline that is fast approaching.\n\nWhile it seems unlikely that the Sultanate could meet the overall ASEAN target, movement forward on both a feed-in tariff scheme and smart-grid infrastructure suggests that Brunei Darussalam is well-positioned to achieve its more modest goals.\n\nChapter Summary"}

I'd been getting leg pain and considered changing trainers as cushioning was perhaps at fault. Turned trainers over to assess wear and all the grooves were full of tiny stones, grit etc. Can't believe I hadn't noticed before. Spent a few minutes digging them all out and VOILA!! Bounce restored and at least a few pounds lighter too! You can send me thanks in cash, chocolate or other shiny forms......\n\n1 message\nForum Jump\u00a0\u00a0\n\nRW competitions\n\n  \u2022 Closing date: 30/10/2016\n\nRW Forums"}

Tickets for the contest are $20 for adults and $15 for children (19 and under). The game will mark Alfonso Mondelo's debut as Mutiny coach. The Mutiny received special permission from Major League Soccer to train before the scheduled Feb. 1 official start date in order to prepare for the match with Celtic. The Mutiny players will begin reporting back to Tampa the first week of January and begin training Jan. 8 at Land O' Lakes Recreational Complex. Celtic will venture to Orlando for training during a break in its 2000-01 season. Following a Jan. 2 Premier League meeting with Kilmarnock, Celtic will break from competition for three weeks before playing in a Jan. 27 Scottish Cup match. The event marks the Mutiny's first meeting with Celtic, the first British team ever to win the coveted European Cup (1967). Tampa Bay has participated in four other international friendlies in its history -- falling to Colombian First Division club Millonarios in July (6-2), defeating the Puerto Rico National Team (11-0) in 1999, and producing draws with English Premier League club Leicester City (0-0) in 1997 and Dutch First Division team Feyenoord (1-1) in 1996.\n\nNo comments yet.\n\n\n\n\nRecent\u00a0Soccer America Site\nSaint Louis picked to repeat\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\nUEFA Champions League viewing schedule\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\nYoung Arsenal star suffers horrendous injury\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\nGAMES: Live and same-day delay on national TV\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\nCHAMPIONS: Goal difference gives PSV Dutch title\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\nFABIEN BARTHEZ: French great bolts after assault\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\nMEXICO: Pachuca leads six into quarterfinals\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\n>>\u00a0Soccer America Site Archives"}
{"dataman_score": 4.0, "text": "Guide to laser eye surgery\n\nMost people are happy with the results of their laser eye surgery.\n\n\nWe are Australia's leading consumer organisation with over 160,000 members.\n\n\n\nand Policy\n\n\nConsumer News\nand Investigations\n\n\nConsumer Product Testing and Reviews\n\n\nGet access to all CHOICE BENEFITS\n*Billed quarterly as $22.95\n  \u2022 Updated:3 Apr 2007\n  \u2022 rateraterateraterate: Member rating\n\n01 .Choosing a clinic\n\nWoman with blue eyes\n\nIn brief\n\n  \u2022 There\u2019s no guarantee you\u2019ll end up glasses-free, but many people experience an extremely reduced dependence on them.\n  \u2022 It\u2019ll cost you around $2500 per eye, and neither Medicare nor most health funds will pay for it.\n\nPlease note: this information was current as of April 2007 but is still a useful guide today.\n\nMost people happy with the results\n\nSince it was first performed in Australia in the early 1990s, laser eye surgery to correct vision has become very popular, with many thousands each year choosing it to correct their long- or short-sightedness or astigmatism. Forty CHOICE readers told us about their experiences with laser eye surgery. The vast majority were very happy with the results and would recommend or repeat it:\n\n  \u2022 \"It\u2019s amazing to look at a distant mountain range and actually see trees.\" Michelle, NSW.\n  \u2022 \"I feel younger and it\u2019s so much easier running, exercising, swimming and generally enjoying life.\" Dee, Victoria.\n\nNo regulation\n\nIt's fortunate so many people are satisfied with the results of laser eye surgery, because essentially it's an unregulated industry. A surgeon needs no formal postgraduate training in laser eye surgery before setting up to do it, and you don't have to have a referral from any medical practitioner.\n\nSo how do you make sure you get an experienced surgeon and a good clinic?\n\n  \u2022 Your GP, optometrist or ophthalmologist may be able to recommend a surgeon.\n  \u2022 Check out more than one clinic, both to get a second opinion and compare the services offered. Be wary of clinics that guarantee you perfect vision \u2014 it\u2019s not something that can be guaranteed.\n\nChecklist for choosing a laser eye surgery clinic\n\nThings to look out for when selecting a surgeon and clinic:\n\n  \u2022 Holding an academic appointment indicates the surgeon is actively involved in research or teaching and exposed to peer review.\n  \u2022 What\u2019s the surgeon\u2019s experience with correcting the type and degree of your refractive error? This is particularly important since they need no extra postgraduate training to do laser eye surgery.\n  \u2022 What\u2019s the degree of the surgeon\u2019s involvement pre- and post-operatively? They shouldn\u2019t see you just for the operation and leave the assessments and check-ups to assistants.\n  \u2022 Ask for data on their surgery outcomes. How do they track them? How do the results compare with national benchmarks?\n  \u2022 The clinic should inform you comprehensively about what\u2019s going to happen on the day of the surgery and afterwards. Ask questions and read all the material you\u2019re given.\n  \u2022 If you wear contact lenses, ask for how long you shouldn\u2019t wear them before the assessment.\n  \u2022 Does the price include check-ups and, if necessary, enhancement procedures? (These are further operations that may be necessary if the first procedure leaves the eye over- or under-corrected.)\n  \u2022 Accreditation to a quality standard such as ISO 9000 is an indicator that the clinic has written quality procedures in place.\n  \u2022 Don't go by cost alone; the decision you make will affect you for the rest of your life. Or, as David from Victoria put it: \"It was pricy but I was happy to pay it for a very experienced surgeon. My eyes are too important to penny-pinch.\"\n\nSign up to our free\n\n\n\n02.Expectations and costs\n\n\nWhat to expect\n\nMost people will see better after laser eye surgery, but there\u2019s no guarantee you\u2019ll no longer need glasses or contact lenses.\n\n  \u2022 Slightly to moderately short-sighted people have the best chances of success, with more than 90% achieving 6/12 vision and many 6/6 vision or better. A person with 6/12 vision \u2014 the legal requirement for driving in many Australian states \u2014 can see at six metres what a person with normal vision can see at 12. The old term for normal vision was 20/20 vision, referring to feet instead of metres.\n  \u2022 People with worse short- or long-sightedness can still benefit from the surgery, but might have to temper their expectations.\n  \u2022 Although astigmatism can be treated as well, its type and severity will affect results.\n    So keep your expectations realistic \u2014 no surgery can guarantee you can throw away your glasses. In fact, you\u2019re very likely to need reading glasses anyway as you get older, as laser eye surgery won\u2019t prevent the onset of the age-related vision problem presbyopia. (It won\u2019t speed it up either, though it might become more noticeable after surgery.)\n\nAs\u00a0Georgia\u2019s story shows, her expectations seem to have been a key point in how happy she was with the results of her surgery. It didn\u2019t leave her free of glasses but greatly reduced her dependence on them. So if you\u2019re aware of the surgery\u2019s limitations and the potential complications and risks it entails, and you\u2019re still convinced it\u2019ll improve your lifestyle, laser vision correction might well be worth the thousands of dollars it\u2019ll cost you.\n\nThe costs\n\nThe cost of laser eye surgery varies, depending on the type of procedure and the technology used. The clinics we consulted \u2014 some of which offer interest-free loans \u2014 charge between $1500 to $3700 (on average $2500) per eye. This is in line with what you told us you paid for your surgery over the last few years, mostly without any contribution from a health fund.\n\n\"It\u2019s the best money I\u2019ve ever spent \u2026 Unfortunately, I was unable to claim a cent through my health fund [as] it\u2019s considered cosmetic surgery. I\u2019m unhappy about this as I won\u2019t be claiming either glasses or contact lenses ever again.\" (Shelley, WA)\n\nHealth fund contributions\n\n  \u2022 Five of the six major health funds we contacted confirmed they pay no benefit for laser eye surgery to correct vision (NIB, HBF, HCF, MEDIBANK PRIVATE, MBF); only one of the ones we contacted (HBA) covers it, with some conditions. (Smaller, industry-specific health funds such as Defence Health and Teachers\u2019 Federation Health Fund may also give some rebates.)\n\nMedicare benefits\n\n  \u2022 Medicare pays no benefit for most laser eye surgery either \u2014 only if it\u2019s required to treat certain eye diseases. Otherwise it\u2019s seen as cosmetic, as it\u2019s generally done to eliminate your need to wear glasses.\n  \u2022 In something of a contradiction, however, the Australian Tax Office regards the surgery not purely as cosmetic, as it\u2019s changing the eye\u2019s function, not its appearance. It\u2019s therefore still a claimable expense for the medical benefit tax offset (which pays for 20% of your net medical expenses above $1500).\n\n03.Techniques and technologies\n\n\nLASIK (laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis)\n\nThe procedure\n  \u2022 The surgeon cuts a tiny flap in the outer layer of the cornea so a laser can reshape the tissue underneath, before the flap is placed back over the treated area.\n  \u2022 The flap is either cut with a miniature scalpel or created \u2018blade-free\u2019 with a fast, computer-guided femtosecond laser, which is also called by its brandname, IntraLase.\n  \u2022 Currently the most popular procedure \u2014 your eyes should feel fairly comfortable the day after surgery, when you can probably resume normal activities.\n  \u2022 The more effective option if you\u2019re more severely short- or long-sighted.\nOn the downside\n  \u2022 It has been linked to the rare condition ectasia, where the cornea bulges out because it\u2019s been structurally weakened, resulting in poor-quality vision.\n  \u2022 There\u2019s a small but significant additional risk of surgical complications, mostly associated with the corneal flap \u2014 it can get lost or damaged, cut incompletely or completely cut off, to name a few. However, the developments in computer-guided femtosecond laser technology are designed to improve precision and make flap creation safer.\n\nPRK (photorefractive keratectomy)\n\nThe procedure\n  \u2022 A type of laser treatment to the surface of the eye that entails no flap creation. Instead the surgeon scrapes off a portion of the very top corneal layer \u2014 it\u2019ll grow back naturally \u2014 before reshaping the surface with a laser.\n  \u2022 A simpler procedure than LASIK with a lower potential for complications \u2014 the most common technique before LASIK gained popularity during the last decade.\n  \u2022 Particularly suitable for correcting lower degrees of short-sightedness and astigmatism.\n  \u2022 May also be recommended if you have a very thin cornea.\nOn the downside\n  \u2022 Compared with LASIK you\u2019re likely to feel more discomfort.\n\nLASEK (laser-assisted subepithelial keratomileusis) and EpiLASIK (using a finer tool)\n\nThe procedures\n  \u2022 Modified and refined procedures based on PRK, where the top layer of the cornea is pushed aside during the surgery and replaced afterwards to preserve more corneal tissue. However, both procedures still involve laser surgery on the surface of the cornea, not inside the eye, as with LASIK.\n  \u2022 Developed as a treatment for people whose cornea is unsuitable for LASIK.\n\nWavefront-guided technology\n\n  \u2022 The latest development in laser eye surgery that can be used with both types of procedure and has the potential to improve the quality of vision, especially when correcting larger refractive errors.\n  \u2022 It involves taking a detailed scan of the eye that\u2019ll reveal all its refractive errors and programming this information into the laser, which can then deliver a more tailored treatment.\n\n04.Risks and complications\n\n\nLaser eye surgery for vision correction can change your life for the better, but you need to be comfortable with taking a certain risk, as no medical procedure is totally risk-free and the results are irreversible.\n\nLaser eye surgery has been performed for more than a decade now and over that time, the complication rate has proved to be generally low. Around 5% of patients report problems following it.\n\nThe most common problems occur during the first few weeks after surgery and include:\n  \u2022 Over- or under-correction, or residual blurry vision, which requires another \u2018fine-tuning\u2019 enhancement after three months.\n  \u2022 Dry eyes, or inability to produce enough tears to keep the eyes comfortable, especially after LASIK.\n  \u2022 Visual symptoms, especially after PRK, affecting night-driving ability, such as corneal haze, glare and/or haloes, starbursts around lights, blurry double vision or light sensitivity.\n  \u2022 Eye sensitivity after PRK or other surface treatments.\n  \u2022 Other, less common problems include myopic regression (where eyesight changes back to the pre-surgery state), lower contrast sensitivity and less crisp vision, even with glasses or contact lenses.\n  \u2022 Visually threatening complications are very rare. But as with any other surgery, there\u2019s always a slight chance of infection, especially within the first two days after surgery. It\u2019s rare and more common with PRK than with LASIK. Infections can lead to scarring and, in extreme cases, blindness.\n  \u2022 As it\u2019s a fairly recent procedure, the long-term effect of removing corneal tissue is unknown, but so far no studies have suggested that there\u2019ll be complications in the long term. Most problems discovered so far occur in the first year after surgery.\n\nCommon vision problems\n\nIn the normal eye, light rays pass through the cornea at the front of the eye and the lens behind it focuses them as a sharp image onto the retina at the back. When the cornea or eye is misshapen, however, we see a distorted or blurred image (called a refractive error). The most common errors are:\n\n  \u2022 Myopia (short-sightedness) - light rays are focused in front of the retina, leading to an inability to see far, or blurred distant vision.\n  \u2022 Hyperopia (long-sightedness) - light rays aren\u2019t yet in focus when they reach the retina, leading to blurred close-up vision.\n  \u2022 Astigmatism - light is focused at different points because the cornea is uneven, leading to blurred or distorted vision at all distances.\n\nLaser eye surgery\n\nLaser eye surgery is an irreversible procedure that\u2019ll permanently alter the curvature of your cornea. (There are other procedures, such as a lens implant, but this is the most common.) Varying degrees of myopia, hyperopia and astigmatism can be corrected with laser eye surgery, either singly or in combination.\n\n  \u2022 An ophthalmologist (opthalmic surgeon) performs the operation, most commonly in a laser eye clinic, with a computer-controlled excimer laser that uses pulses of ultraviolet light to reshape the corneal surface \u2014 flattening it in short-sighted people, sculpting a steeper curve if you\u2019re far-sighted and evening the curve out to correct astigmatism.\n  \u2022 Ophthalmologists are registered medical doctors who assess eyes, diagnose diseases, prescribe corrective devices and carry out medical and surgical procedures. However, they need no formal training to do laser eye surgery.\n  \u2022 For a description of the various laser eye surgery see Techniques and technologies.\n\nPresbyopia \u2014 the age-related loss of our ability to focus on near objects \u2014 can\u2019t be corrected with traditional laser surgery, but monovision or conductive keratoplasty may help. With monovision your eyes work independently \u2014 you use your dominant eye for distance and the other for near vision. This condition can occur naturally, or can be created with contact lenses or laser treatment. But not all people can tolerate it, so you may want to trial monovision first with contact lenses before you decide on surgery. Conductive keratoplasty (CK) is a radiofrequency heat treatment to the peripheral cornea that\u2019s less invasive than laser surgery. It can be used to correct small degrees of long-sightedness or improve reading vision in one eye.\n\nMore information\n\nExtremely happy, but not glasses-free\n\nGeorgia from Bega, NSW, had LASIK surgery a few years ago after early, unsuccessful PRK treatment, and is \u201cextremely happy\u201d with the results, although it hasn\u2019t left her glasses-free.\n\n\u201cI can legally drive a car without glasses and only need my glasses occasionally,\u201d she says. \u201cBefore the treatment I had a myopia of \u20137, which meant I had to leave my glasses beside my bed so when I awoke I could find them to read the time on the bedside clock. Being short-sighted controlled my life, now it doesn\u2019t,\u201d Georgia says.\n\nShe now chooses to wear glasses when she wants to see really clearly \u2014 such as for driving at night, or at the movies. Otherwise she doesn\u2019t need them.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s given me much greater freedom, even if it\u2019s only perceived. I didn\u2019t expect to get 20/20 vision after the operation, and I think that was the most important thing in the way I view the success of the treatment \u2026 I have no regrets.\u201d\n\nUnobscured view down the ski slope\n\nJim, of Echuca, Victoria, couldn\u2019t tolerate contact lenses, so was stuck with glasses for 30 years and got pretty tired of wearing them all waking hours.\n\n\"The worst for me was when snow-skiing, which I loved. I\u2019d get partway down a run and the glasses would fog up from the exertion, so I\u2019d have to stop three or four times to wipe them. If I left the glasses off, I couldn\u2019t see ruts and bumps and kept falling over,\" he says.\n\nA few years ago Jim gave LASIK a go. Apart from a few days of gritty and dry eyes, he had no complications. With his dominant eye he now has better than normal vision. The other eye was deliberately left a little short-sighted so he can read fine print without glasses.\n\n\"I can see better than I ever could with spectacles,\u201d he says, \u201cand six years later it still gives me pleasure to be able to look at things without those pesky bits of optical plastic in the way. Pity I\u2019m too old for skiing now \u2026\""}

Yesterday, the FTC secured a temporary injunction against the keylogger software vendor CyberSpy, ordering that company to cease and desist from selling its product online.\n\nIn its original complaint, filed November 5, 2008, the FTC alleged (PDF) that CyberSpy (under the ownership of one Tracer R. Spence) has committed unfair/deceptive acts, either in or affecting commerce. Since August 2005, CyberSpy's main product has been a charming keylogger named RemoteSpy. As keyloggers go, RemoteSpy is (or was) fairly run-of-the-mill. Upon purchase, the would-be spy chose a login/password that would be used to monitor the collected data thereafter. The company's hook appears to have been the level of service that accompanied the program. The FTC's complaint states that numerous tutorials and \"how-to's\" were included with RemoteSpy, including information on disguising the payload in order to maximize the chance of infection.\n\nOnce it infects a machine, RemoteSpy devotes a fair amount of energy to staying invisible. According to CyberSpy, the program will not display entries under \"Add/Remove Programs\" or the Start Menu, and is invisible to both the list of running programs and the list of running processes as displayed by the Task Manager. RemoteSpy hides its own install/data aggregation directories (no word on whether or not these are made visible by ordering the OS to reveal normally invisible folders and files), and will copy itself from location to location to prevent the end-user from permanently deleting it. When it's not busy ducking under bridges or diving into storm drains, RemoteSpy aggregates chat logs, login information and associated passwords, email, IM conversations, and pretty much anything else it can find. Screenshots of the unwitting user's desktop are reportedly snapped every five minutes or so, though that's probably variable.\n\nUnderstanding the FTC's objection to this kind of software doesn't require a law degree. The complaint states: \"Defendants have collected personal information from computers without the knowledge and consent of the owner... have stored the information on Defendants' servers, and have disclosed the information to unauthorized third parties. Defendants' actions cause or are likely to cause substantial injury to consumers that cannot be reasonably avoided and is not outweighed by countervailing benefits to consumers or competition.\"\n\nThe presiding US District Court judge agreed, at least enough to issue a temporary restraining order. As much as the FTC deserves an \"A\" for effort, however, the timeline of the case is an excellent example of how poorly equipped the government is when it comes to addressing this type of problem. The brief states that RemoteSpy has been available since \"at least August 2005.\" The company in question\u2014CyberSpy\u2014apparently did business in Florida for long enough to be clearly identified as residing in that state, while the company CEO/manager, Tracer R. Spence (a close anagram of Spencer Tracy, though I'm not saying it's an alias) is similarly known.\n\nThe FTC's own press release states that it authorizes the filing of a complaint when \"it has reason to believe that the law has been or is being violated, and it appears to the Commission that a proceeding is in the public interest.\" Apparently, the public interest can take a while to sort out.\n\nBotnets, malware, and other various forms of attack evolve and spread at a rate that's literally multiple orders of magnitude faster than the FTC's most expedient response. Long term, I suspect we'll ultimately see a joint team, led by both industry white hats and government investigators, but the framework for operating this sort of organization (US-CERT is the most relevant current example) has yet to fully materialize. Until such time as it does, government organizations will have only a very limited ability to address current malware threats.\n\nUPDATE: The fine folks at the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) have informed me that they filed the initial investigation request with the FTC.\n\nExpand full story\n\nYou must to comment.\n\nYou May Also Like\n\n    Need to register for a new account?\n\n    If you don't have an account yet it's free and easy."}

More than 98 percent of convicted felons are bread users.\n\n2. Fully HALF of all children who grow up in bread-consuming households score below average on standardized tests.\n\n3. In the 18th century, when virtually all bread was baked in the home, the average life expectancy was less than 50 years; infant mortality rates were unacceptably high; many women died in childbirth; and diseases such as typhoid, yellow fever, and influenza ravaged whole nations.\n\n4. Every piece of bread you eat brings you nearer to death.\n\n5. Bread is associated with all the major diseases of the body. For example, nearly all sick people have eaten bread. The effects are obviously cumulative:\n99.9% of all people who die from cancer have eaten bread.\na) 100% of all soldiers have eaten bread.\nb) 96.9% of all Communist sympathizers have eaten bread.\nc) 99.7% of the people involved in air and auto accidents ate bread within 6 months preceding the accident.\nd) 93.1% of juvenile delinquents came from homes where bread is served frequently.\n\n6. Evidence points to the long-term effects of bread eating: Of all the people born before 1839 who later dined on bread, there has been a 100% mortality rate.\n\n7. Bread is made from a substance called \"dough.\" It has been proven that as little as a teaspoon of dough can be used to suffocate a lab rat. The average American eats more bread than that in one day!\n\n8. Primitive tribal societies that have no bread exhibit a low incidence of cancer, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's disease, and osteoporosis.\n\n9. Bread has been proven to be addictive. Subjects deprived of bread and given only water to eat begged for bread after as little as two days.\n\n10. Bread is often a \"gateway\" food item, leading the user to \"harder\" items such as butter, jelly, peanut butter, and even cold cuts.\n\n11. Bread has been proven to absorb water. Since the human body is more than 90 percent water, it follows that eating bread could lead to your body being taken over by this absorptive food product, turning you into a soggy, gooey bread-pudding person.\n\n12. Newborn babies can choke on bread.\n\n13. Bread is baked at temperatures as high as 400 degrees Fahrenheit! That kind of heat can kill an adult in less than one minute.\n\n14. Most bread eaters are utterly unable to distinguish between significant scientific fact and meaningless statistical babbling.\n\nIn light of these frightening statistics, we propose the following bread restrictions:\n\n1) No sale of bread to minors.\n\n2) A nationwide \"Just Say No To Toast\" campaign, complete with celebrity TV spots and bumper stickers.\n\n3) A 300 percent federal tax on all bread to pay for all the societal ills we might associate with bread.\n\n4) No animal or human images, nor any primary colors (which may appeal to children) may be used to promote bread usage.\n\n5) The establishment of \"Bread-free\" zones around schools.\n\nposted on Feb, 10 2004 @ 01:00 PM\nWonderbread!

A Hamilton Township woman reported having a pet taken by a coyote on three occasions. In one instance, a large cat was killed.\n\n\"The coyotes have become so brazen in our area that they have actually come on our second-storey deck,\" Nancy Blakely said. It \"terrified\" her daughter \"because she thought it was a burglar on the deck.\"\n\nThe Dale Road resident said she used to leave her children outside when they were young.\n\n\"I don't feel I could do that now,\" she said.\n\nMs. Blakely was told by the MNR \"there was nothing they could do\" and that she had the right to shoot coyotes on her property.\n\n\"I don't want the shooting of animals in my area,\" Ms. Blakely said. \"Nor do I want to kill the animal ... It really is the Ministry of Natural Resources' responsibility to come trap the animal and relocate it.\"\n\nHamilton Township staff contacted the ministry and learned the coyote population is \"at a peak right now,\" clerk Kate Surerus said in a report to council Dec. 6. The ministry added, however, that the coyote population, \"through nature, is self regulating\" with diseases such as canine distemper and mange reducing their numbers.\n\nThe clerk concluded the MNR \"supports balancing nature\" and believes people and animals should \"learn to live in harmony with each other.\"\n\nThat didn't stop Hamilton Township from urging the ministry \"to take action against coyotes due to their brazen behaviour and danger to pets\" but Mayor Mark Lovshin admitted he didn't know what that might involve.\n\n\"We were looking for their expertise as far as a solution,\" he told County council. \"I don't know what the answer would be ... They're the experts in the field, I would hope they could come up with something.\"\n\nWarden Gil Brocanier said coyotes have migrated into Cobourg. He spotted one standing on a sidewalk one night.\n\n\"The problem is pervasive, it's not unique to the rural areas,\" he said.\n\nThe MNR is not considering bringing back a bounty on coyotes that kill livestock because it's \"more random than solving a problem\" and \"does not address menacing coyotes,\" Ms. Surerus said in her report.\n\nOn its website, www.mnr.gov.on.ca, the ministry advises residents to discourage coyotes by removing sources of food by protecting pets and livestock, fencing gardens, and securing garbage and compost.\n\nBookmark and Share\n\nCommunity Contributions"}

I believe as a people, we are here.\n\nOur forefathers have paid a price for us, they suffered, they were sold into slavery, they were beaten on the boats to get here. Mistreated. They split our families up, couldn\u2019t go to school. They paid a price.\n\nAnd the reason they paid was a door for us. And that door is for others to hear our story. We need to take it to the world. There are others who are suffering, others are going through struggles.\n\nThey need to hear our story, they need to hear how we made it through.\n\nListen to the early spirituals that talk about the Jordan River, talking about getting across the Red Sea. Nobody knows the Jesus that I know.\n\nAfter the Civil War, African Americans went to the mission field. The country of Liberia was founded by freed slaves. Some of our historically black schools, like Spelman College, one of its reasons, it\u2019s development, it\u2019s founding, was to send African Americans \u2013 missionaries \u2013 to Africa. If you could see the old pictures, you\u2019d see the nurseries, these Spelman people ministering in Africa.\n\nPeople want to know more about us, they want to hear our story and it gives them hope.\n\nThey know somehow or another we went to this country, and they see us as prosperous, whether it\u2019s good or bad, whether it\u2019s entertainment, seeing the movies, or music. We have some significance.\n\nI remember being in Venezuela, out in one of the neighborhoods, and one of the guys said, \u201cnow, is Tupac dead or alive?\u201d That was the beginning of a conversation. They love our music, we have talents that we can take, they want to listen to us.\n\nPeople came to us, and asked all the questions.\n\nThe doors are wide, wide open.\n\nPeople listen to us. And when we go overseas, at least when I did, people wanted to ask questions.\n\nWe were up in the mountains, and this African, from a distance, recognized that perhaps my voice was different, or I had more weight than the average Kenyan, and he yelled from a distance, and he said, \u201cyou! You negro from America!\u201d And then he came running to us, and he hugged me.\n\nAnd he asked a question, he said, \u201cAre there any negro Christians in America?\u201d And I said, \u201cSure. Plenty.\u201d And he said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we see them?\u201d\n\nThen I thought, the harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few.\n\nAnd then it became important that part of our movement literally sends African Americans to Africa, and I promise I will do the best I can to see that happen.\n\nIt\u2019s the gospel, and we need to take it to the world.\n\nWe need to take it, and they want to hear. They want to hear the rest of the story.\n\nAnd they\u2019re willing to listen, and we can go and all those to do go see God use them in a great, great way.\n\nLearn more about The Impact Movement and its mission opportunities."}

I\u2019d never go back on the show again.\u00a0For a while I thought I would given the right amount of compensation from CBS, but no. I wouldn\u2019t put my friends and family through the hassle, and I don\u2019t want to be remembered for going on the show anytime after this current season. Big Brother\u00a0is becoming less and less CBS, and more MTV.\n\nWhen they were casting for All-Stars in 2007 I was flown out to LA and I met with the gang at CBS again. I\u2019d lost my dad to kidney failure in 2004, and my mother had tried to take her life as a result in 2005. I sat there with the producers and I answered their questions about what\u2019s new and how does a second season of\u00a0Big Brother\u00a0sound to me. I felt like I was in a cave most of the interview, and I felt disconnected from reality. I was an emotional wreck since winning BB, but nobody knew it.\n\nI answered all the producers\u2019 questions but they knew my heart wasn\u2019t in it. I\u2019d already returned to work in banking since winning my season, and I\u2019d also been running a little side business. I was focused on making money and running away from having to deal with death and depression in my family. Going back on Big Brother\u00a0was not the right move for me. All-Stars happened without me, but I did judge a Food Competition that season with Marvin and Nicole. That was enough for me.\n\n\nSince All-Stars I\u2019ve stayed in touch with many people still on the Big Brother\u00a0team, even after moving to Belgium and starting a family of my own. It\u2019s their job to keep in touch with BB alum. CBS always has a way of tracking you down somehow even if the rest of us think you\u2019ve gone MIA. It\u2019s their job. For all those who think CBS doesn\u2019t keep tabs on BB alum to use them if ever there comes a time, for anything, you\u2019re wrong. They do. It\u2019s their job, even for dinosaurs like me. Dinosaurs can be coaches too.\n\nTheir jobs must be getting harder in recent seasons with all the death threats and FBI-calling. I\u2019m thankful my season was so long ago when less was at our vicious fingertips. I remember my cousin Miran, who was barely a teenager, had watched my season from home and ventured online to a\u00a0Big Brother\u00a0forum. In the forum I was being torn apart by rabid fans who hated me, and naive little Miran attempted to defend me. Quite innocently Miran thought that letting internet trolls know that she was related to me, and that she could vouch for me, would help support me.\n\n\nMiran was chased off the forum crying, and traumatized. Growing up in a sheltered suburb of Delaware, Miran had never been accused of being \u201cprobably a lesbian who eats Jun\u2019s pussy\u201d or the like. I felt horrible. I still feel bad, but it\u2019s funny to us now. That really was mild compared to 10 years later, today.\n\nThe internet is a wondrous place, but it\u2019s also a clogged drain of anonymous hate to an extreme degree when it comes to\u00a0Big Brother.\u00a0It\u2019s the reason I stopped watching\u00a0Big Brother 15\u00a0and I know I did the right thing because my summer\u2019s been peaceful. This is the first summer in years that I haven\u2019t had my life threatened, or my family threatened, and my distancing myself from\u00a0Big Brother\u00a0has been better all-around.\n\nI say I\u2019d never go back on the show because nowadays some fans take it so far that people losing their livelihoods is not enough. Threats of rape and torture and death, and harassment of all kinds and outlets, has become the norm in recent Big Brother\u00a0seasons. No amount of money or thirst for fame could ever make me get close to any of that, even if I know I\u2019d win if I ever got back in the\u00a0Big Brother\u00a0house. I know I would, but it wouldn\u2019t be worth my family having to have to go into hiding for months for their own sake.\n\nIt\u2019s not easy to turn off the hate when it\u2019s coming at you consistently in the public. Ignoring it is harder than you\u2019d think, even though it\u2019s the easiest thing to say. Some\u00a0Big Brother\u00a0alum choose to stick around and interact with fans while others drop their\u00a0Big Brother experience\u00a0and return to life. Some do both, and some do it better than others and for different reasons. The more you\u2019re in the public eye, the more everything.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot wrong with people who go into the\u00a0Big Brother\u00a0house, but they\u2019re exponentially outnumbered by the lots going wrong with fans outside the\u00a0Big Brother\u00a0house. Fan rage escalates every year. How far can it go?\n\nAlways dishing,\n\n\nPosted under: Big Brother, Reality TV Dishes\n\nTagged as: , , , , ,\n\n\n  \u2022 Jun,\n    Thank you so much for this post. Some of these fans sicken me. It has been a dream of mine to do BB since I was younger. I just graduated college and no longer think I will do it. These people try to destroy you if they dislike you. Just know we all aren\u2019t like this. They are messing it up for everyone. Have a great day :)\n\n    \u2022 Oh there are some true friends I\u2019ve made through fans. Thankfully there are fans who still respect themselves and others and make the BB experience a good one. I don\u2019t think I would have ever applied for the show if not for 10 years ago :)\n\n      \u2022 Here I thought this article was going to be more about the realities of BB and holding them accountable for their own misdeeds. The whole world knows there are sicko\u2019s everywhere and no one in the public eye is omitted from their insane attacks. They aren\u2019t just limited to people who appear o BB so I have to assume you knew the risks. In this article you speak of the death threats and so on that you and your family endured but strangely you wait 10 years to voice your concerns which makes me wonder how serious did you take those threats. Don\u2019t get me wrong I sympathize with you and your family and everything you\u2019ve experienced as a result of your appearance on BB, I just have to wonder if your speaking out now because your really fed up or is it because of the backlash \u201cHelen\u201d has received.\n\n      \u2022 Shelly on August 29, 2013 at 12:39 pm said:\n\n        I count myself as a true friend\u2026and blessed because of it! This has been the most disgusting season of human display ever. I want on so bad and yet I am so glad I\u2019m not tied to this season. I think BB should go away now..but it won\u2019t. Too cheap to make every one says. Great article\u2026and surprsing but awesome decision my friend. So what I never got to be ur AS2 campaign manager\u2026as in gifting..it\u2019s the thought that counts. :)\n\n    \u2022 I applied to be on BB 4, 5 , 6, 7 and 8 . It consumed me for 5 years. It is all i talked about and thought about. I got called in for an interview for BB4. I flew into LAX and got a Taxi to take me to the Hotel that they were doing the interviews . I spent the night and got up early the next morning for the interview and in my head it was a No Brainer\u2026 They were going to pick me to be on the show. :) They didn\u2019t\u2026.. I got my notice in the mail 3 weeks later saying Thank You for meeting with us etc etc, please apply again next year. So I did\u2026. year after year after year. My son and I went to the casting calls in Sacramento, Bakersfield and at CBS Studios. I met / talked to a few of the house guests from previous years and I will always remember Marcellas telling me \u201d Be careful for what you wish for \u201d and then he said\u2026. Laura, you are too nice to be on Big Brother. :( It broke my heart, but the older i got, i realized Marcellas was right. I am not a mean spirited person. I don\u2019t believe everyone that goes in the BB house is, but I think when you are verbally attacked over and over again then your claws will come out. I am sure that would have happened to me and that i would have gotten pretty ugly in there and would have embarrassed myself and my family. So I have to say Thank You to Big Brother for not picking me. The fans would have called me lots of names I am sure and even though I might have been able to handle it back in my early 40\u2032s, i am now 53 and I wouldn\u2019t subject that to myself or my friends and family\u2026 It just isn\u2019t worth it. I feel the most sorry for is Amanda\u2019s, Aaryn\u2019s, Andy\u2019s and Spencer\u2019s families\u2026. I am sure their families wish they had never heard of Big Brother. :(\n\n      \u2022 NewHavenMom on September 2, 2013 at 8:41 pm said:\n\n        I agree. Don\u2019t forget GM\u2019s family. Not alot to be proud of. I can\u2019t even get anyone I know to watch BB because it is so disgusting. Amanda and her sex, bullying and hate is deplorable.\n\n  \u2022 T. Burke Hodgson on August 28, 2013 at 11:40 am said:\n\n\n    Big Brother isn\u2019t fun any more. Both the cast and the fans in the live feed chat rooms are mean and vicious. I thought last years series was great fun \u2014 particularly Ian \u2014 but these are ugly people with ugly morals or the lack there of. I hope the consequences in real life of their appearance on the show is severe. I also hope the CBS legal department is having a very nervous summer.\n\n  \u2022 I\u2019m glad you didn\u2019t go back for all-stars. I know you\u2019re the most hated houseguest in big brother history, but i\u2019m not going to threaten you. Have a good day Jun. :)\n\n    \u2022 I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t go back. Am I really the most hated HG?! No way! Where can I get confirmation of that?! I\u2019d need to add that to my bio\u2026\n\n      \u2022 I\u2019m pretty sure that Maggie still holds the title. I don\u2019t understand why because she played the hell out of the game in her season and actually deserved to win. I wasn\u2019t a fan of her as a person but not every BB fan can put their personal feelings aside and judge someone based on their gameplay and that\u2019s just sad.\n\n      \u2022 just_a_dude on August 28, 2013 at 10:04 pm said:\n\n        For what it\u2019s worth, you were my favorite houseguest in BB4, and, in my opinion, the best winner thus far! (BB3\u2032s Lisa is a close second in my book.)\n\n      \u2022 Shelly Erb on September 2, 2013 at 3:22 pm said:\n\n        Seriously?? The most HATED??? Not in a million gazillion years\u2026 Try Russell or the Hanz guy\u2026 and now\u2026 Amanda and Andy\u2026 Jun ~ you are classy and honest and you have a good heart\u2026 I loved you on your season and these \u201cfans\u201d who are so hurtful and mean-spirited need to remember that you are speaking about HUMAN BEINGS and think about how it would feel if you were spoken to or if it was YOUR family who was being spoken to or about\u2026 Come on people\u2026 I get not liking someone or not agreeing with someone ~ but can\u2019t we be kind about it and not use personal attacks on each other\u2026 Peace\n\n    \u2022 Oh, I don\u2019t believe that at all\u2026. until this year, I believe Evil Dick was the most hated\u2026 Now I think it is a tie between Evil Dick, Amanda and Aaryn\u2026. Most annoying this season is McCrae, Andy and Spencer\u2026. JMO though :)\n\n      \u2022 Evel Dick has a ton of fans. Amanda will top him 10000 times over in the most hated department.\n        At least Dick being an asshole was strategic. He never talked about wanting to kill people or \u201charpoon\u201d there child\n\n  \u2022 LoveableNiki on August 28, 2013 at 11:58 am said:\n\n\n    Jun, when you initially stated on Twitter a few days ago that you\u2019d never return, it caught me off guard being a Twitter follower for so long. Thank you for this post. I understand. I often tease my mother that I am going to apply. I actually downloaded the application last summer. I\u2019m no BB3 Dani, so I\u2019m not sure I would get far. (My mother says I\u2019d be evicted first. She\u2019s probably correct.) It saddens me the vile comments and thoughts that have surfaced this season. Thankfully, therapy is available to these HGs. They will need it.\n\n    \u2022 Yeah. Sadly this season and recent seasons have pushed me away a little. It\u2019s all good.\n\n      As far as therapy goes\u2026it\u2019s not what it sounds like. Nobody\u2019s holding your hand or available 24-7\u2026 These HGs will probably just go back to their lives\u2026some of them jobless.\n\n      \u2022 With the threats being made, there are petitions available to have a HG removed. Hoping this will happen, Jun. The season you were on my daughters watched it with me. Sadly now, I wouldn\u2019t ever consider letting any kids watch. PG18 .\n\n  \u2022 I always wished they\u2019d do an \u201cAll Stars\u201d where every previous winner came back and played. But with one in prison and others who probably won\u2019t return (do you think they could keep Evel Dick in the house THIS time?!), it\u2019s unlikely to happen. I liked that they did the first six seasons, THEN had an All-Stars, then went on with the original concept. I don\u2019t like the mix-and-match they did the pat two seasons, even though the concept was great. But I know what you mean about Big Brother and The Real World. The Real World was good when it was real people, but when they started choosing only beautiful people and finding ways to get them into hot tubs all the time, I lost interest. There must be a demand for Real Housewives-type reality, but most of us like watching REAL people act genuinely. Once it feels scripted or everyone starts looking like they\u2019ve spent the last five years in a Botox factory, people like me will move on to something else.\n\n    \u2022 Anonymous on August 28, 2013 at 2:02 pm said:\n\n\n      Jun, you are, and always will be a class act to me! I don\u2019t blame you one bit for feeling the way you feel, nor do I blame you for stepping away from this season! I have loved this show from episode one in 2000, and I am deeply saddened that in the past few years it\u2019s become increasingly like a looks & youth contest, instead of a diverse group of regular people who are willing to participate for the fun and because they actually love the game. I, personally don\u2019t want another all-stars for season 16. What I would love to see is for CBS to revamp the show with regular folks, aged 30 & up. It would be refreshing to the platform for Big Brother, because it would redirect the show to a point where there is actual gameplay. Nothing that these people are doing this year could compare to what older & wiser people would bring to the game, because with age & life experience comes real deceit & treachery! I have wanted to be on the show for years, but the age demographic has been lowered too much & that\u2019s a problem! There are many many super fans like myself who are in their early 40\u2032s, 30\u2032s & others who want it so badly, but won\u2019t get that unless CBS changes something. It\u2019s become a show about young hot kids, and that\u2019s very unfair to the show itself, as so many of us apply, but get turned away because of our age or we aren\u2019t \u201cpretty\u201d or \u201chandsome\u201d enough. Sure they may have cast one or two \u201caverage looking\u201d people in the past few seasons, but it made no difference, as the \u201cbeautiful people\u201d quickly got rid of them. CBS needs to mix it up, or I feel as if they will end up pulling the show, leaving us regular folks in the lurch with nothing great to watch during our summer. Just my opinion. Love to you, Dave, & beautiful little Noah!! Keep being the beautiful, loving, funny woman you are, as you are an inspiration & a blessing to us all!!\n\n      \u2022 Anonymous on September 1, 2013 at 8:02 pm said:\n\n        I totally agree with this poster\u2019s comments and suggestions for a BB16 season. I have just been furious with this season in all ways, questioning why CBS doesn\u2019t step in to help, then realized this is exactly what they wanted. Makes for good TV. BTY: my hubby & I are age 70, and we love BB. I\u2019d like a season with an entire older cast. We could kick ass too!\n\n  \u2022 I hope it feels good for you to make that decision and get it off your plate. I know I am way too invested for you to ever return!! Hahaha. It sickens me that \u201cfans\u201d often exhibit the traits they claim to hate in the targeted HG. I was so disillusioned when I first discovered recruiting. I could not imagine why CBS could not cast < 20 people from what has to be thousands who apply. And then I realized my na\u00efvet\u00e9. Money. Cheap \"talent\", inexpensive production, huge ratings. So why not make it \"better\"? They knew what they needed in a cast and damnit, they were going to \"find\" it. BB jumped the shark when they got too heavy-handed, IMO. I still love my BB. But where has it gone?\n\n  \u2022 @nojobny on August 28, 2013 at 2:12 pm said:\n\n\n    Another great post. I remember years ago, for a brief millisecond, I actually thought about signing up to be on the show. Then I found my first messageboard about BB -OMG they had every detail of the contestant\u2019s lives. I wanted no part of that microscope. Now the scrutiny is 1000x worse.\n\n    You\u2019re so right to move forward. I\u2019ve seen some of the vitriol you\u2019ve gotten on twitter. I would hate to see that directed to Davy or Noah (since no one is off limits to the crazy cat ladies!)\n\n  \u2022 For all of the mob mentality that goes on at BBUK evictions, it is all, as they say in G.B., panto. The crowd boos and cheers but at the end of the day it\u2019s all in good fun. Like at a wrestling match. I am turning more and more to other countries BB shows for my BB fix. They are just more fun. I think I have turned my US feeds on maybe 10 times mostly for live comps. I\u2019d rather watch the nightly UK feeds or the fun tasks and open feelings of AU\u2019s show. Maybe because of these shows, I am still hopeful that our BB can regain what it has lost. Humanity.\n\n  \u2022 James Baker on August 28, 2013 at 2:48 pm said:\n\n\n    Hi Jun, CBS is kind of in a Catch 22 when it comes to Big Brother. If they play to diehard BB fans they will completely isolate the game from potential new fans, if the pander to the masses and cast a bunch of strong personalities that make watching compelling or that evoke polarizing opinions, the natives get restless about the game. So it\u2019s really no win for them. I agree with you though, seems like this season more than most has brought the crazies out both inside and outside the house. I would propose that CBS take a one year hiatus and send Kass and Grodner on to other projects and maybe try BB 16 in a couple of years with new production and casting and see if they can recapture some magic because this season has just been sad.\n\n  \u2022 I stopped watching 3weeks ago. I think the game is no longer BB as it was. The HG are even worse than in season 8. Racism threats etc. It became to much for me. I\u2019ve seen enough of that kind on VH1 and Mtv. It\u2019s not Big Brother game anymore. How can Alison Grodner allow all this crap? I hope this is the last season I will never support the show again by watching live feeds or watch the episodes. They have rules after the people they hate or love in the production. Like last season they let Willie go though they should let Joe go too. My god even his coach (so called) provocted him. The production knew exactly how they should do to provoke him out of the house. In Chima\u2019s case the had no choice but to let her go (they wanted her there but she started misbehave in such matter they had to expell her.) This years production favorite is Amanda Aaryn and GinaMarie and probably Elissa too. But it wasn\u2019t the viewers that voted her MVP for the week it was all CBS like it was CBS that nominated Amanda just to get her angry.\n    That girl is mental and should not be there. I even \u201clike\u201d Aaryn more than her.\n    I watch clips on YouTube (Amanda making a fool of herself) and keep Free update online. I don\u2019t need to watch and I don\u2019t want after this very nasty season that really shows that it\u2019s Big Brother that pressures the player making moves they don\u2019t want. They pressured Jen last year to save Dan.\n    Thank you for writing this June. Now I know there\u2019s nothing wrong with me hating BB15 .\n\n    Take care from Scandinavia\n\n  \u2022 I agree that the Internet is a \u201cclogged drain of anonymous hate to an extreme degree\u201d\u2026and not just about Big Brother. The faux courage of an avatar and screen name give people license to display the worst that humanity has to offer about entertainers, politicians, athletes, and even their neighbors. But I agree that there is something that has happened to stoke the fires of fan rage surrounding Big Brother and other reality shows. I saw it when my 11-year-old son was watching with me the night the Judd was evicted and when we discovered the Helen was responsible, my son pointed at the TV and screamed, \u201cYou B***h!\u201d That was a stellar parenting moment that I tried to turn into a teachable moment by talking about editing and how it\u2019s just a game and we don\u2019t really know any of those people well enough to judge the entirety if who they are. But an 11-year-old doesn\u2019t get that so he\u2019s not watching anymore. I really wish I could walk away from it myself because I haven\u2019t watched a single episode after which I didn\u2019t feel the need to go shower AND brush my teeth, but I confess I\u2019m still tuning in\u2026not because I\u2019m rooting for anyone, but because my husband and I have watched this show together for so long that I have a sentimental attachment to it as our summer guilty pleasure. But the guilt is getting to be too much\u2026if you can get over any attachment that YOU might have as a former houseguest, then maybe it\u2019s time to get over mine.\n\n  \u2022 Yeah, fans are assholes. To be honest, I think that this is the Internet in general. When people are anonymous, they think can be as vile and disgusting as they want. It\u2019s probably for the best if we ignore people like that. They\u2019re just a bunch of cowards anyway.\n\n  \u2022 Dear Jun,\n    thanks for sharing this. I\u2019ve been watching since Season One. I\u2019ve always wanted to be a part of Big Brother. I know in my heart I\u2019d never play like a lot of players have played and are playing this season. I used to Love Big Brother. I liked you on the show. I never had a problem with you hon. :) I was happy when you won. :) but, now, 11 season\u2019s later, I think I\u2019m done. Simply because they choose to leave Amanda inside the house. They\u2019ve removed players in past seasons for being a threat to someone\u2019s well being inside the house. why can\u2019t they do that with Amanda? why, because she\u2019s not physically acted upon her verbal threats? are they waiting for her to act upon her threats? are they willing to let Elissa die inside the house just for Ratings? I pray to God that\u2019s not the case. I, as well as thousands of other Big Brother fans Fear for Her safety. She fears for her Safety, inside the house. So much, she feels the need to lock herself inside her HOH room, just to protect herself from Amanda. What happens next week when she can\u2019t lock Amanda out, to keep her away from her? what then? must she be forced to just wait til no one\u2019s watching, at just the right moment, and then die in her sleep because of the Threat that Amanda made about slitting her throat while she\u2019s sleeping? I do not want to see it come to that. Why is CBS allowing Amanda to stay inside the house? isn\u2019t it in the Rules that if Any houseguest is made to feel like they are no longer safe inside the house, then the one that\u2019s making them feel that way, would be removed immediately from the game? if so, why are they Not removing Amanda for doing just that!? they\u2019re basically saying it\u2019s Ok for Amanda to Terrorize Elissa by keeping her inside the house and doing nothing! this is Why I no longer want to be a part of this show. this is Highly Unacceptable. I\u2019m glad your not inside the house now\u2026. simply because I\u2019d hate to see you going thru what poor Elissa is going thru. If Amanda wins, as is the rumor going around that she\u2019s been predertmined the winner, I\u2019m Done with Big Brother & I\u2019m Done with CBS for Good. Sorry this is so long\u2026 but I needed to Vent. and thank You for your time, and for sharing your story. I greatly appreciate it. and I don\u2019t blame you for how you feel about them now. I honestly don\u2019t. not after this Season. God Bless You & Keep your family Safe & well.\n    Love You, Eve\n\n    \u2022 Nancy Alexander on August 28, 2013 at 4:40 pm said:\n\n\n      I really don\u2019t think El feels threatened by Amanda. If so she wouldn\u2019t be lol in her face. And I think the reason she\u2019s locked herself in hoh was to have a peaceful place that was quite and serene to do her yoga then take a nap. If she felt Amanda\u2019s threats were real she would have gone to the Dr and told them. She\u2019s a smart lady and knows Amanda is all hot air\n\n  \u2022 Nancy Alexander on August 28, 2013 at 4:35 pm said:\n\n\n    As you know I adore you and as you know I don\u2019t care for Amanda. Last pm when people were threatening Amanda\u2019s parent on twitter I made the comment most parents don\u2019t raise their kids to act this way and it\u2019s not their fault that she\u2019s accountable for her actions not them..I got my 1st threat. As a mom I know and you know we raise our kids to be polite and kind to others. My son is 20 yrs older than Noah and it hurts you as a mom when you see or hear your child be unkind and you correct them and reason with them why we don\u2019t hurt people or be rude. The man\u2019s next post after threatening me was his wife was in labor and headed to hospital. God help that innocent child. I still defend Amanda\u2019s parents of being innocent of her actions, she did it not them. This coming from an Elissa fan\n\n  \u2022 This is why you are one my favorite alums. I\u2019ve never seen your season, but simply because of your Twitter and this blog you\u2019ve became of my favorites. Thanks for being real and enjoyable unlike the HG\u2019s I\u2019m currently living with. I know I\u2019ve got big lips, but I\u2019m not trying to suck ass. I promise. Enjoy your day!\n\n  \u2022 well written article as a die hard bigbrother fan, thanks you for giving so much back to the fans . if you ever go back you would rock it ! i will always have love for big brother one of my favs shows! and would never stop watching cus its soo addicting! anyways thanks jun for everything whoooooooooooooooooo\n    kid shacky!\n\n  \u2022 Jun, you weren\u2019t above trashing people yourself when you were a special consultant to BB CBS some where along BB 5 or 6. You only tucked tail and ran when some of the posters turned it back on you.\n\n  \u2022 Great post, Jun. I have been a huge fan of BB since Season 1, and miss the days of smarter players and more interesting seasons. I also miss the days of fans not being rabid & out for blood. :(\n\n  \u2022 I happen to come across your blog because britney haynes retweeted you. never knew who you were, but going through your blog, why do you keep talking about bb in every single freaking post of your blog if you hate BB so much. obviously you wouldn\u2019t be where you are if you had never been on bb. if you have given up on watching bb bc of all the things that have been this season then stop talking about it. but yet you still continue to talk about bb bc without it, you\u2019d be irrelevant. (as evident by you; saying your most viewed post was about you no longer watching bb anymore)\n\n    just saying don\u2019t bite the hand that feeds you, hypocrite.\n\n    \u2022 If Jun never EVER wrote about big brother again, she would still retain most of her followers. Jun is more than BB. Jun > BB. For a while she wrote about it because she was paid to do so. People enjoyed it and she gave them what they wanted. But her writing encompasses so much more than a quick perusal of recent topics will show.\n\n  \u2022 Jun,\n    what a great post, I agree this season is unlike any other Big Brother Season in my opinion, After watching your season on YouTube I was a fan of yours, I like how you won\u2019t go back to Big Brother and want to be remembered for who you were and not go on now and become somebody your not just to please a group of people. It sickens me that so-called fans today have to hate one another for liking who they like. I always like Big Brother in the fact that you watch the strangers enter a house and you know nothing about them but then end up knowing everything about them and become fans of them and cry for your favorites being evicted. Then get emotional when the winner is announced. But this season I think the cast was a series of misfortunate casting. I think this season they tried to cast the young players, but then super-fans were in the mix and what they said led them to cast them and it was mixed up casting. I think these super-fans would do much better in a different season. But the this is the time they auditioned and got chosen because of what they said about this is the only time they could be on the show because like Helen wants to have more kids and better job and won\u2019t be able to be cast later on.\n\n    I don\u2019t understand why \u201cFans\u201d have to go out of their way to find information of the family members and treat them as if they were garbage. I don\u2019t do that, I know this is a game I pick the houseguests that I like and root for them and the ones I dislike I love to hate sort of thing that is all.\n\n    Big Brother is summer reality show where you can get involved in so many ways, Fans please don\u2019t turn on the hate, Keep it fun and remember the true reason you became a Big Brother fan in the first place.\n\n  \u2022 Anonymous on August 28, 2013 at 7:03 pm said:\n\n\n    I can\u2019t blame you for not wanting to come back Jun cause the casting for the last few seasons has been horrible. This season may have been better if not for the automatic MVP twist going to the only person with a Big Brother family connection. They either cast a bunch of brain dead zombies like BB14 who were willing to throw money out the door for their precious coach (the Final 4 screw-up) or were willing to do whatever their coach wanted them to even at their own detriment. This season the overloaded the house with A-types (I wonder why they never put A-types in the house with returning players\u2026.hmmmmm) that were just going to explode all over each other.\n\n    Robyn Kasting proved she can put a good cast together (Canada) but it seems like she doesn\u2019t have the same power with Grodner running the show. Do you think Grodner is the reason for the downfall cause Shapiro seemed to run a better and less production manipulated game? Sorry to see you never again playing Big Brother but will always listen to you snark-out the hamsters in the house.\n\n  \u2022 Great decision not to ever go back! The fact is \u2013 you won! Most people will never even get close to being on a show like that and you accomplished that to the max! No need to prove yourself again nor put your whole family through the trauma of it all \u2013 too many jealous haters out there. Bravo Jun!\n\n  \u2022 seems this season that you are allowed to threaten peoples lifes for the sake of higher ratings but do it on the outside then the police get involved. to get families involved for what their kids are doing is wrong in my book.\n\n    last season frank berated ian on a constant basis but no threats of death or rape were said, this season shouldnt even have happened. who is to blame? CBS is to blame for allowing people to speak their minds, slapping a disclaimer at the beginning of the show is just a cover up for- we like the racism,threats,bullying etc in the house because more viewers tune in to see what is going on. in my opinion i think its sad to exploit people for the sake of ratings but then again the Hgs chose to go on a reality show for a chance to win big money and possibility of fame, but was it worth it?\n\n  \u2022 You \u201d know\u201d you would win? Yeah okay, haha. But yeah BB fans can get quite nasty, especially nowadays, just read the bb15 hash tag.\n\n  \u2022 scott whitmon on August 28, 2013 at 7:27 pm said:\n\n\n    Its sad to me that its gotten so easy for people to show how stupid and vile they can be . I\u2019m a huge BB fan and have opinions on HGs . But I can\u2019t imagine the need to threaten someone\u2019s family or try to get then fired . It makes me embarrassed to be a fan of the show when I read that kind of thing .\n\n  \u2022 Anonymous on August 28, 2013 at 7:34 pm said:\n\n\n\n  \u2022 I love this letter and its one of the reasons why I adore Jun\u2026 I have been a fan of Big Brother since season 1. I have started watching feeds during season 10. Late bloomer for the feeds but I do recall following forums especially during Season 6 of Janelle, Kaysar and the Nerd Herd \u2026 As I watched the feeds each year I tend to always find one or two house guests to \u201chate on\u201d which is normal\u2026. I also tend to forget about it when its over and think its funny how, as cray cray they appeared on the feeds, they became integrated into the Big Brother \u201cfamily\u201d. I disliked Shelley and Kalia when the trashed talked Rachel but once the season ended I saw there was no \u201chard feelings\u201d at least not publicly\u2026. I grew to like Shelley and Kalia in the twitter world and thought how they really must have had to deal with the hate of others once out of the game\u2026 This season Is the first time I found myself disgusted with 90% of the house\u2026 I found myself shocked by the homophobia, racist comments, and just plain vile talk. I hate the word \u201cC**T\u201d and have never heard it used so much by one group of people.. As a 50 year old gay man in NY I have heard a lot\u2026 but nothing like this cast of Big Brother folks. I have been guilty in calling the House Guests \u201cParasites\u201d \u201cfame whores\u201d and my favorite \u201cVile Waste of Human Flesh\u201d. I have cancelled my feeds but realized I had an addiction to this show when someone sent me a free link and I again watched\u2026 After speaking to several people who have played in the game of Big Brother I have realized my name calling in Facebook groups and twitter only contributed to the hate of these people. I would never dream of threatening someones life or even calling, harassing or threatening a family member of one of these people\u2026 I had to look at these people and realize whether real or fake or scripted or rigged\u2026 these house guests will have to deal with the real world when the game is over. Most will be forgotten by the masses and only remembered by the die hard BB fanatics (am i one?) \u2026 I realized I would no longer say the house should be fumigated, these people need to be exterminated yada yada\u2026 I actually have begun to feel sorry for them. Especially my home girl Gina Marie, who because I know where she is coming from, I can see why the things that come out of her mouth are falling. I will no longer call her a parasite but what she is is an uneducated young naive girl who is a product from her area in Staten Island\u2026.. its sad. I wish i was in the house to shake her up and speak to her\u2026 Much Like Elissa tried to do last week. ALL in all I don\u2019t hate these people \u2026even Amanda and Aaryn \u2026 I think they have some serious issues that they will need to handle in the coming weeks. Part of me also will now always question the game of Big Brother and just how much is REAL ? How much is stunt casted? How much is production prompted ? etc. I thank the former BB players including JUN for giving us this insight\u2026 Jun you will always be my number one BB gal!\n    Johnny \u2013 Gianni862 on twitter\n\n  \u2022 After reading this I\u2019m really turned off by big brother. I mean this season has been bad enough with all the disgusting comments from the contestant but now I see how some of the fans are just as bad as the contestants. This really changed my view on big brother. All the years I wanted to go on but now I feel like it would be a terrible decision for myself and my family.\n\n  \u2022 Jun, why does it seem like the crazies are at an all time high this year. I don\u2019t blame you for not going back & subjecting your peeps to all of that. Like you I\u2019ve pretty much given up on BB15 & have been just reading BBDish. Some chick was on there yesterday wanting to start a petition to get Amanda kicked out & went on some rant about Amanda working for CBS & that it\u2019s all rigged for her to win. Spouting off about lawsuits & threatening bodly harm. It\u2019s crazy!! I like the \u201cold days\u201d when most folks just watched the 3 nights on TV & had no idea what was going on the rest of the time.\n\n  \u2022 Anonymous on August 28, 2013 at 8:47 pm said:\n\n\n    Yes the fans comments can be vicious, but this season the fans were provoked. Normally, the fans are upset because of game play and/or because they don\u2019t personally like the players. BB15 is different. Fans have the right to be upset. The racial comments offends many. In my opinion, the mean comments made by fans are in defense to the racial and degrading comments being made by the house guests.\n\n  \u2022 Jun, I wish every \u201cfan\u201d of the show would realize that people outside of the game are off-limits. Time and time again, it is hard to join in on a chat on the live-feeds or post a tweet about the game. There are \u201cfeeders\u201d who condemn the personal attacks on the HG by make personal attacks about the HG. I just don\u2019t get it. Since there have been a lot of remarks made by HG this season that are full of bigotry, it does not do anyone any good to contact outside family members by making threats what-so-ever. Social media has done more damage to the Big Brother game due to the \u201cfans\u201d of the show. Instead of attacking, threatening, or wishing harm to HG or his or her family members, why not take these moments to educated and have a civilize conversation about the themes going on. I love watching the live-feeds because I get more out of the game play and I understand the HG better. As for the bigotry comments made by HG, I can only hope that they will learn from this experience. Many of them have already been punished by losing their jobs and even some respect by their friends and family. It is not up to me or anyone else to make threats against family members or antagonize the family to get a response. No one else knows what it is like to be in a place where every single move you make is taped except for those who have actually been a HG on that show for the last 15 seasons. My mother and I talked about the other day is that HG who seem to be \u201cenemies\u201d on his or her season are not that way after the game. I am sure there have been past HG who kind of drop away and do not have a connection with the BB world anymore. As much as I would like to see you play again for an All-Star season, I can respect your decision not to play again. I do enjoy your tweets on Twitter! Thank you for a well-written blog.\n\n  \u2022 Interesting comments, good read. I have watched every season and I too turned it off around week 3. It is disgusting the way the fans treat the HG\u2019s. I keep asking how can fans get so upset and go to such drastic steps to make the HG;s life miserable. Then I ask myself how can CBS let the HG\u2019s do what they have gotten away with this summer and not expect some one to get upset. I have watched BBAustralia and the HG\u2019s are disciplined for making any form of strategy comments to other HG\u2019s. I have never seen bullying, name calling, yelling, rubbing some one\u2019s clothing article up their ass or manipulating other HG\u2019s. They are also discipline if they break the rules, 3 strikes you are out of the BBAustralia house Why isn\u2019t CBS calling these HG\u2019s out? Is this what is upsetting the fans to take such drastic steps? You can talk racism and say it is inappropriate all you want like Julie Chen did on \u201cThe Talk\u201d but the only way to stop it is to take action. CBS put a disclaimer on their live feeds and at the beginning of the show. BIG DEAL. In my humble opinion CBS doing that is saying, sorry folks you may find this defensive but we have a tv show to run here and we have to do whatever it takes to get our ratings up so tough shit. CBS has lost the concept of what the show was meant to be and will allow the house guests to do whatever they want and let them say whatever they want. Like many other shows that loses the concept maybe it is time to say good bye to BBUSA before someone really does get hurt.\n\n  \u2022 Good for you :) I\u2019ve never watched your season, but I can already tell there\u2019s a reason why you won. You are a strong and intelligent woman. Keep doing ya thang <3\n\n  \u2022 You can count me as a fan and most important a repectful fan of the show and people. This season is in a class by itself. The earlier seasons consisted of ordinary, regular individuals with ordinary regular jobs. Something went wrong along the way when models, hopeful actors filled the show. Not everyone is in perfect shape and looking for more exposure for their modeling and acting.\n    What is it when people come into the house and have sex. Come on people you are playing for $500,000. I miss the game play, I miss the alliances (secret & open). I miss the talks of trying to figure who needs to stay or go. You don\u2019t put up and vote out people for personal reasons. The decisions should be based on what is best for you. I miss regular people like Chicken George. Who didn\u2019t like Chicken George.\n    I don\u2019t understand death threats inside and outside of the house. People should go in and play the game and remember it is a game worth $500,000.\n    I still like to follow some of my favorite players. I follow because I care and because they made the game fun.\n    The hate needs to go inside and out of the house. Why can\u2019t we just have fun like we use to.\n    I think BB should go back to everyone playing for the veto, it was more fun to watch.\n    The nasty behavior is horrible this season and I quit watching. I want the Big Brother of the past back where I like some, dislike some, but never truly hated anyone.\n\n  \u2022 jezziebezzie on August 29, 2013 at 1:30 am said:\n\n\n    I can\u2019t even believe what this has all turned into. I engaged someone yesterday to explain the FBI was involved to someone seemingly unaware without realizing that they were playing dumb & had directly contacted one of the HGs family. I was sickened when I scrolled back & saw what they\u2019d typed.\n    I do think CBS/Producers bear some responsibility. If they had similar rules in place for hate speech as in other countries (BBUK S8 for example) then the 1st to say something horrible would be gone & the rest wouldn\u2019t think they could so freely speak the way they\u2019ve continued. (I hope that will be addressed for next season.) At the same time, I think the feedsters wouldn\u2019t have been quite so divided & whipped into a frenzy if players got kicked out. In my mind the blows inflicted upon Candice will impact her longer & were much harder than any Willie dealt to the Chef last year.\n    That being said, there is NO excuse for what\u2019s been done. There\u2019s no excuse to threaten a family member or try to interfere with a HGs personal life in any way, shape or form. Particularly while they\u2019re in the house & unaware of what\u2019s happening.\n    I\u2019m so sorry for what your cousin went through during your season. And sadly, you\u2019re so right. The immediacy of the technology makes it even more invasive today.\n\n  \u2022 Jasmine Voosen on August 29, 2013 at 1:59 am said:\n\n\n    Jun, I watched your season and you rocked. Keep taking care of your family and telling it like you see it. If others don\u2019t agree, it\u2019s their issue. :)\n\n  \u2022 Matt Jones on August 29, 2013 at 10:33 am said:\n\n\n    First things first \u2013 you\u2019re just so damn sexy Jun. You are welcome to come marry me if you ever find yourself in need of a new husband ;) haha Now, on the topic of the article, I really enjoyed reading things from your standpoint. I can totally see why you have had more than enough of BB. The \u201ccat ladies\u201d of BB online forums have gotten to be so ridiculous. Apparently, Amanda\u2019s family is now receiving death threats, Silly.\n\n  \u2022 Is it really that bad? How many threats do people actually get? Is it just a few? Or are we talking thousands? No one should threaten someone over a tv show. I would never do it but you have to wonder how bad could it be? only 7 million people watch and only thousands watch live feeds.\n\n  \u2022 Hello Jun. Yes the BB concept started out good but has morphed into something I do not recognize. I understand the strategy,lying,wheeling, dealing and yes maybe even the pots and pans of Evel D. I do not condone the bigotry, racism, slurs, death threats (on the show itself), destruction of personal property, the child porn that was discussed on this season, sexually explecit scenes, personal attacks on fellow hg families, BB has become legal porn in this sense.\n\n    To listen to a contestant saying \u201cI want to choke them till I feel the bones crumble in their throat\u201d and other various personal attacks is unacceptable. I can\u2019t imagine how I would feel trapped in that house with another hg saying \u201cI want to cut them up\u201d, \u201cI want to kill them\u201d, \u201crape\u201d, \u201cstab\u201d, \u201cput their personal parts in their mouth\u201d, etc. These statements are not only directed at fellow hg but children and family of the hg.\n\n    My thought since CBS feels they can hide behind a disclaimer, is to contact the sponsors of the show/CBS and inform them that this is not a show they should invest in. Not the families of the hg. CBS can put up a list of disclaimers but in reality they are teaching the viewers, (teens, college, and some times younger) that being a bully is not only ok but profitable. We wonder why our youth has gone nuts?\n\n    The casting of hg is seriously lacking. Psych medications should be a red flag to investigate further before they place some one in the house. Sharing of drugs is illegal and that has happened this season, probably not the first time.\n\n    I disagree vehemently that the public fans contact family members outside the house. They are innocent bystanders and have zero control of a chronologically designated adult in the house. Even though a number does not make you and adult.\n\n    Production has rules that the hg sign, an agree on, and they have penalties for activities that can get control of an out of control guest. The hg have blatant disregard for themselves, the fans, and production. They shout out to production \u201cf\u2026 you\u201d, \u201cI hate the fans\u201d, etc. Never have I seen a penalty nom, stipend punishment, or carried a out reprimand on an inappropriate hg.\n\n    Public outcry can be taken seriously now so that is one benefit of the internet. Directed appropriately it has the possibility to be effective.\n\n    You can not go on the internet sites and have a decent discussion of opinions without being bashed and harassed, so the fun has gone from the supporting fan sites. Some of those sites even insight more hate.\n\n    As far as anonymous posts, some are usually by irate fans that are out of control themselves, others are more likely to protect themselves from harassment and bashing because of a difference of opinion. \u201cIf it\u2019s not my opinion, death to you\u201d type thing. No one can seem to agree to disagree in a dignified manner or allow some one else to have an opinion.\n\n    I too have stopped the live feeds, stopped the AD show, and glimpse now and then to see \u201cwith hope\u201d if some kind of change has taken place. Thus far it hasn\u2019t so I am ending my viewership with this season. Which will be easy since I will be starting my travels to visit all of the states and see the sites. No tv in the Grand Canyon, etc. When I settle back down BB will not be on my list of must see tv shows any more.\n\n    Your decision note to go back on BB, appears to be a sensible one. No amount of money is worth the nightmare this show has become. I remember when the hg would laugh and dance and play along with the planning and scheming. That BB is gone. I doubt it will return. BB\u2014other countries seems to have a handle on their hg and control what is acceptable and what is an ejection from the game. Kick out the bad seed and enter a new hg if you need to.\n\n    Thank you for bearing with my rant.\n    Good luck and God bless in all you do.\n\n  \u2022 Jesstears on August 29, 2013 at 9:31 pm said:\n\n\n    What gets me about BB now is they will allow racists remarks and beds being turned over but they won\u2019t allow a little head butting to take place. Aaryn\u2019s word could insight and if they did, who would be at fault, Aaryn or the others?\n\n  \u2022 Sooooooo, if you are done with and saddened by Big Brother, then why not dish about something else? Why even promote it at all, or blog about it any more? I don\u2019t understand devoting time and energy to something that no longer serves you, and you claim your life us happier without it. You have managed to stretch your 15 minutes out into a decade, so why not pursue other interests that represent less negativity to you? I am sure someone as talented as you are has other interesting things to share with your fans. Best of luck to you, and I will be interested in hearing about new and more important things from you!\n\n    \u2022 I do believe i\u2019m allowed my own dramatic exit after a decade of involvement with a show that gave me half-a-mil haha. But I get your point. 15 minutes is nothing and I never saw my interactions with decent fans as \u201cfame\u201dbut it\u2019s a television show so it\u2019s been public.\n\n      I actually do spend copious amounts of time blogging about things other than BB\u2026\n\n      Thanks for the vote of confidence and backhanded slaps on the butt :)\n\n      See you in the future!\n\n  \u2022 Anonymous on August 30, 2013 at 2:06 pm said:\n\n\n    Wow! That is crazy and so so hard to imagine people saying/threatening such horrible things\u2026it is truly sad. I hope you and your family are happy and doing well now! Thank you for such insight into the BB world I knew was insane but just not how much\u2026\n\n  \u2022 Don\u2019t you think the houseguests get worse too? That in turn makes fans worse? I know we\u2019ve had vile HG other seasons but watching the feeds this season I hear threats of rape,killing daily. I heard Amanda say she wanted Elissa to get her throat slit & the blood used as lube to rape her..I felt physically sick. Nobody is innocent but the casual way she makes these comments scares me. I guess people on general are going downhill. Sad!\n\n  \u2022 Anonymous on August 31, 2013 at 8:31 am said:\n\n\n    I tend to agree and disagree with your post. But before I do that, I must profess to you Jun that you have always been my favorite bb winner, as I\u2019ve watched through the years since I was 13 years old. You\u2019ve always been the smartest and only winner I actually wanted to win a season. I used to dream of going on the show until I realized fame is not for me and I prefer to be out of the limelight, so to some respect I think people accept (just like celebrities) when they agree to join BB that there is a possibility they may be harassed, stalked, or shed in a negative light (not that it\u2019s right but its inevitable to some extent). I am glad you came out about the stuff and struggles your family went through and it sucks as I am sure Candice and Howard and all these contestants will feel form the backlash after this season is over. And yes, this season sucks \u2013 totally agree, but I really don\u2019t think it is a decline and BB has gone crappy on us in total. Don\u2019t equate this season with all seasons, don\u2019t lose your love for a show that reminds us of humanity on a small scale. I loved last season. I hated season 9. It\u2019s hit or miss based on casting. And this is unfortunately a miss. Same goes for the world I guess\u2026. hit or miss. Not all people are great out there and some people will be bullies and mean girls (and sadly racist too) even more so if pressured in a house, BB is a microcosm of reality on a smaller scale. The fans are reality as well on a larger scale. So don\u2019t give up hope on the show. This glimpse at the world that is Season 15 is a terrible one.\n\n  \u2022 Richard Wilts on August 31, 2013 at 5:26 pm said:\n\n\n    rawilts Jun i\u2019m a big fan of yours most of the time didn\u2019t like when u attack Jenelle because she left her baby to go on BB . of course when i mention that to u on twitter u block me But here is how u fix BB you let America choose who goes on the block and who is evicted every week that way the HGs will have to respect each other if they want to stay off the block and if they act like an ASS America will put them on the block and at the end of the game America and the World votes and decides who wins\u2026 by the way frist prize should be 1,000.000 second prize 100,000 third prize 50,000 Jun i,m still a big fan of yours i use to love reading your twits God bless u an your family\n\n  \u2022 Anonymous on September 1, 2013 at 7:48 pm said:\n\n\n    this show is rigged and Allison Grodner is friends with amanda\u2026 thus, she will win come hell or high water! Used to love this show but cant deal with the producers manipulating this game any more!\n\n  \u2022 I watched the first episode online the day after it aired and haven\u2019t watched since. I\u2019ve been a fan of the show since season 8, but I\u2019ve done a 180. It\u2019s trash, nothing but trash. When most house guests are wanna-be actors/models, people who apply for every reality show in existence, the appeal is lost. People forget that it\u2019s supposed to be a social experiment, but that angle no longer exists. It\u2019s about who can be the loudest, most obnoxious attention whore, or which guy can be the biggest douche. They cast low rent people for this very reason, anyone who believes they genuinely look for decent human beings when casting is going on, is simply naive.\n\n    As I said before, I haven\u2019t watched but the first episode of this season, but I check Jokers every now and then and I\u2019m aware of the controversies of the season. This isn\u2019t anything new, the show hasn\u2019t regressed to the point that people believe it has. It has always been this way. The reason the racist/\u201dhomophobic\u201d (what a ridiculous word) comments were made into a big issue this season is the same reason everyone knew about the Trayvon Martin incident. We live by double standards in America, the media especially. Black people and gay people are off limits, anyone else is fair game. A perfect example of this is when Chima repeatedly called Russell a \u201cmuslim extremist terrorist\u201d multiple times during her season. Did CBS blow that up? Did that make TMZ? No, of course not. Why not? Because Chima is black. Why did we hear so much about Aaryn, GM, and even George Zimmerman? Because two are white and one is \u201cwhite-hispanic\u201d. Love when the media invents a term when an agenda needs to be fulfilled. I guess we have a white-black president then.\n\n    The point I\u2019m attempting to make is that BB has been straight trash for quite awhile now, the controversial comments made this season are nothing new\u2026they\u2019re just being blown out of proportion because of the double standards that exist in this country. The sooner you people stop watching this horrendous show the better, I promise you\u2019ll be better off for it. Don\u2019t reward AG and CBS with your time/money for intentionally preying on and exploiting mentally unstable people for financial gain.\n\n  \u2022 Great post Jun. Just wondering, I noticed through past comments/posts that you aren\u2019t too keen on Julie Chen. What\u2019s your thoughts on her?\n\n  \u2022 Jun\u2026I can say this in complete honesty, during season 4, and even re-watching the season I was never a fan of yours. Not that it matters, and at the same time it was never personal like I would want anything bad to happen to you or anyone. As someone watching the show we all had players we would pull for to win the game.\n\n    Your honest perspective on the show prior to and since BB4 is much appreciated and exposing your thoughts is a comfort. As we all age and mature we gain a better understanding of who we are, how we treat or talk with others, and a real emotional connection in and out of our own personal lives.\n\n    I did not want to see you on BB7 for the simple reason the players on that show would have been anything but beneficial to any type of game you would have played. Look at Allison, Diane, Jennifer, and Jase as an example of strong \u201cplayers\u201d who were just brushed off because they were not a part of that specific in-crowd.\n\n    I applaud you for over time getting on with what is important in your life and family. BB4 was the summer of 2003, 10 years later your obvious expressions of the games evolution should be read by all, thank you.\n\n  \u2022 the difference with bb is the live feeds \u2026no other reality show has that..that just brings out the crazy obsessed people to choose who they what to hate on\u2026i don\u2019t like julie chen who was an mistress of moonves and broke up his marriage to question anyone\u2019s else character flaws in a ambush stlye..will chen read amanda , ginamaire..chinese remarks on air or all the boys foul mouth remarkes\u2026julie chen can\u2019t pick who is the scapegoat the season..cbs hired jeff schroeder who made gay remarks on his bb season\u2026cbs survivor is bringing back vile racist colton this upcoming season\u2026cbs is the hypocrite and acting like they don\u2019t like it but their action say they don\u2019t give a crap as long as they get good ratings\n\n  \u2022 It makes me sad to know that BB alum are hassled even years past their seasons. I had assumed that once the next season started, the previous housemates were not on the front burner and people would mellow in their feelings. I\u2019ve been in the BB world since the beginning and this season is different. When 2 housemates lost real jobs, and TMZ had it on their front page (as well as main stream talk shows, etc.) I knew something was different this year. A few weeks into the season, when I heard (or read, I can\u2019t remember where I saw it) that you had stopped watching Big Brother this summer, that mattered to me, because I\u2019ve enjoyed watching you on Dick at Nite through the years as well as your blogs and commentary. I know how much you like the show and for you to stop watching it \u2013 it confirmed a lot of what I was feeling about this season. I have watched BB since S1 (with feeds) and this season is a turning point for me also. I like the feeds to see what\u2019s really happening and comparing that to the CBS edited show. As the years have gone by, the forums have turned into a minute by minute dissection of the houseguests. Rarely is anything positive spoken about. This was the season of sheep and for the first time ever I would literally get angry, watching a core group of people spending a stress free summer. My friends would say \u2018isn\u2019t that the point of the game?\u2019 but there is something different about this season. I have already decided I will not pay for feeds again (after paying for them every year since they were black and white and free in S1) and after reading your blog, maybe it\u2019s time for me to have a BB-free, peaceful summer too. I spent weeks angry as the feeds played and that\u2019s not something I want to contribute to again. Big Brother changed this summer and I no longer am entertained. Thanks for your blog Jun \u2013 I\u2019ve always appreciated your views on the show (you, James Rhine and Evel Dick are the combo I really look forward to on Dick at Nite). Thanks for letting us comment and not all of us that have watched the feeds are nutty \u2013 but speaking for myself, this season could be my last. Very disappointed.\n\n  \u2022 Hugopetty on September 3, 2013 at 6:59 am said:\n\n\n    Wow! What an excellent point. That is exactly how I feel about this season. My family and I have all said \u201cRemember when this used to be so fun every Summer?\u201d The new hate-fest feel of these shows just isn\u2019t fun anymore.\n    Jun\u2019s article is awesome and so well said. Every fan should read it.\n\n  \u2022 Jun, I started to watch during your season and I still feel you are the best winner there ever has been since. Casting should stop seeking out people like Kaitlyn, a bartender who didn\u2019t even know what the show was and just cast people that come from the auditions. They always have a few different races and always someone gay, why not have all different ages like they use to. Jerry was always one of my favorites players because he was in his 70\u2032s and wasn\u2019t cast for his looks.\n\n    It is a total shame that people go to these auditions who might be a little overweight or a little older than 30 and not be cast because of it. It\u2019s total discrimination on CBS. Alison Grodner and the whole Kassting team need to be replaced.\n\n    I don\u2019t know why Julie Chen is surprised by this seasons Houseguests. I would think She who is married to the President of CBS might be able to change the way CBS does it\u2019s casting or if not, maybe this show should not come back for 16.\n\n  \u2022 forget rabid fans \u2013 sadly, it seems the HGs were the ones spewing the threats and hate. (in between sleeping and slobbering over their food!)\n\n\n    \u2022 I agree Blah! It\u2019s unrealistic for HGs to spew hatred and not expect hatred in return. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s wrong of them to lose their jobs if their behavior isn\u2019t in line with what the company expects or wants to be associated with. I do think death threats to HG\u2019s are extreme and unacceptable. However, these HG\u2019s have invited lots of problems upon themselves with their own mouths. I don\u2019t think the HG\u2019s families should be mentioned or involved in anyway. This year, the HG\u2019s started the death threats inside of the house upon each other. Such a sad season. I hold CBS 90% accountable for the HG\u2019s behavior. I believe they encourage it by casting.\n\n  \u2022 Much love and respect to you Jun, I completely understand you\u2019re reasoning and agree with you 100 percent. After this season I have a feeling CBS is going to have a lot of damage control to do, I\u2019m honestly surprised that they\u2019ve announced a 16th season at all. This is one year that I wish they\u2019d do a follow-up special say 3 months or so after the finale, just to see if any of the players have had any changes of heart, or to hear of all the backlash they\u2019ve received. Not that I want to hear about death threats, by no means, but I want to know that what we saw on the feeds resonated with at least SOME of the houseguests, and they regret things that they\u2019ve said and done. Tall order but I think the fans were subjected to enough hell, we need some sort of closure.\n\n  \u2022 Bobby flynne on September 15, 2013 at 6:25 am said:\n\n\n    Thanks heaps for this post Jun! It honestly angers me how far big brother fans take it sometimes. It\u2019s like they\u2019re trying to fill the void in their own lives by screwing over someone else\u2019s!! Case in point: Danielle from big brother 14. And the funny thing is, the psychotic fans who are leaving death threats to Andy\u2019s, Aaryns and amandas families, while also trying to get them fired from their jobs, are the SAME ones who are complaining about the racism going too far because its \u201cpersonal!\u201d Practice what you preach you hypocrites\u2026 Attacking someone\u2019s family and job makes you a much more horrible person than any contestant on a simple reality tv show and no amount of comments from your imaginary fatass cat lady friends on jokers updates and the like will ever change that. /Rant. Sorry about that, I just get infuriated sometimes by the nerds who get too involved with the house guests personal lives.\n\n  \u2022 In all honesty, I really did enjoy this season IF you took out all the hatred this cast had. It just baffles me on how vile some people are. The people who I was rooting for on Week 1 are the people who I don\u2019t like no more because of their actions. I just wish things went back to when it started where you put a certain amount of different strangers in a house to compete for a big cash prize. That is probably why the international versions of BB I enjoy since they do that while here they don\u2019t. Plus they enforce the rules while on here they just get a small slap on the wrist and let them continue on. I guess when something that has lasted for so long people will do anything will grasp for anything to gain viewers and such and I guess promoting the nasty behavior from some of these housemates is a way for that.\n\n    As for the fans, I feel like some of them take it to the extreme especially when Shelly got bombarded with threats and everything for evicting \u201cAmerica\u2019s Favorite\u201d. I understand that you will be upset that the person who you were rooting for got evicted, trust me when Helen got evicted and lost her shot to come back in the game I was upset since I was rooting for her, but you don\u2019t see me sending threats to someone\u2019s family because Helen couldn\u2019t keep herself safe. It is just sad to see how vile people can get over something they have no control over. It also makes me scared to try out for the show because I could try to get someone out and that person could be the one everyone is rooting for. So because of me getting them out everyone hates me and wants to make my life a living hell once I get out of the house. That is something I don\u2019t want to experience for playing a game neither should anyone else. People just need to understand the perspective of the situation that these people are put in. If you have a shot to win 500K you will do anything for it and if someone is in your way to win it, by golly you will do your best to get them out. I wouldn\u2019t want to spend 3 months of my life stuck in a studio to hand someone money that I really want. This isn\u2019t a charity, this is a game.\n\n    Enjoyed the post Jun and I\u2019m glad that someone is finally speaking out about this giant mess that BB has turned out to be.\n\n  \u2022 I think the problem with this season (and the \u201cfan\u201d response) boils down to casting. They\u2019re not going for different viewpoints (age/race/economic status), instead they\u2019re just turning it into a Fame-Whore Love Connection nightmare. Personally I think that the level of inappropriate comments by people was only so bad because there were so many people openly expressing them, I think it just grew into an inferno of horrible statements so quickly because there wasn\u2019t really anyone trying to say \u201cHey this is wrong\u201d (at least not anyone who wouldn\u2019t then say something horrible themselves). As long as the statements aren\u2019t rocking the boat in the house, then nothing changes.\n\n    I guess what I\u2019m saying is I hope that the producers learned from this that having a few loudmouth contestants can be entertaining, but if you get a mob of them it becomes a mess. Granted the ratings went up so they might not have learned a lesson at all, but if they got back to the times when they actually had an age gap between players of more than 15 years, I think the show could be amazing again.\n\n  \u2022 I loved your season. I never understood why the other HG disliked you (Alison I could understand). Glad to hear that you are happy and doing well.\n\n  \u2022 I was a huge fan of BB up until the season of Dick. The show was so blatantly skewed in favor of him it was nauseating. The Americas player was a snooze up until the week Dick was scheduled to be evicted and suddenly the Americas player was forced by vote never verified to switch up the vote. From there on the show tanked. After his foul threatening rabid dog performance ( now called strategy ) casting must include screaming, crude, freaks of nature who are fully aware they are cast for this purpose and willingly play to type to the point they corner other contestants threatening them and screaming at them for hours. Although it\u2019s nothing but bullying if you call it \u201cstrategy\u201d and it creates some sick P.R. for the show it\u2019s acceptable. Meet these freaks after the show and they slop so much sugar you quickly realize it was a type cast for ratings which means it was as jun suggested.. MTV.\n\n    I loved season 4 and thought Jun was the winner on week 3. I appreciate the sneaky, manipulative, control freaks that don\u2019t need to show that control but simply implement it while they sit back watching every thing fall into line the way they have perfectly scripted it. To me these are hard working BB players that we won\u2019t ever see again. Although Dan was a bit of fresh/misty air.\n\n    The great Dr. Will in my opinion was more D.R. manufactured then actual truth. It was a given Nicole was shooting herself willingly sending each friend out the door while keeping him in the game. He got lucky during the waterbed key challenge and suddenly he had a chance and they ran with his pontificating in the D.R. about being a puppet master. I never considered him that good at the game. Nicole was just really bad at it. During all stars he had a prior cast and his loud mouthed buddy to hide behind and in the end in one quick move the girl he thought he was using tossed him. Dan I believe would have avoided that moment. JMO\n\n    For me Danielle Reyes remains the queen of this game. Even without the larger check to her name. Never nominated. Never in danger and literally controlled the outcome of every single vote. She had both Lisa and Jason taking her to the end. She listened so carefully to each person she knew how they ticked. Even the implementation of calling Roddy the devil came after a conversation with Jerry first pointing out Roddys creepy control of so many in the house similar to the anti christ. And she simply regurgitated it to let the house marinate on it to get him out. I thought it was brilliant. Getting Marcellus to not use that veto was also methodical brilliance and she did it based on an early conversation at night when he admitted his weakness had always been a desire to be loved by all. All she had to do was assure him he didn\u2019t even need the veto as there would be no way someone so loved by those remaining in the game would ever vote him out. Unfortunately her game was too methodical for a jury with too much information. Roddy couldn\u2019t stand being defeated and along with that bruised marcellus ego worked that jury into a frenzy to make sure the very person who ran that entire jury to the door one by one didn\u2019t get the larger amount of money. It\u2019s a shame because for me she is the ultimate player of this game.\n\n    I caught \u201cthe scandals\u201d of this season and just rolled my eye\u2019s. Although the powers that be would swear they didn\u2019t approve of the comments and behavior you have to wonder if the real thought was .. RATINGS! What a shame. The concept starting from season was incredible. What it has become is a mess.\n\n  \u2022 In reading these comments, I am encouraged. Maybe the pendulum has swung far enough now that we can agree. If enough of us are frustrated with this ever increasing hostility, we might be able to change it.\n\n    If CBS won\u2019t impose limits, then we fans can do it ourselves. By our own behavior, we model what is acceptable. We cannot blame CBS when we do the very thing of which we accuse them. Can we join together in setting some boundaries for each other and for ourselves? Can we agree on some basics? Hate speech and threats are not acceptable. Family is off limits (including real-life facts such as addresses and phone numbers, info on spouses and children).\n\n    What I love the most about BB is that it is a microcosm of ourselves; it is about relationships and power, how we get it and how we keep it. It\u2019s fascinating because it is the ultimate challenge, the human condition. We each have strengths, and we all make mistakes. Remembering this, can we make room for everyone to participate, and make it safe to play and safe to watch? I hope so.\n\nFeel Free to Dish!"}

Customers in the store are asking questions about bikes, anything from a question about a model on the floor to a more specific need to find a light bicycle for competing in a triathalon.\n\nOne can imagine that back in 1894, when the store began, the bikes were less technologically advanced, but the services were not much different.\n\nFor more than 20 years, Ted Sari has been at the helm of the store as its owner.\n\n\"I started off just assembling bikes,\" he said. \"It was just a job for me in the early days.\"\n\nTwo decades later, it's much different.

In addition to families looking for bicycles or individuals looking for repairs on their bikes, people change what kinds of bicycles they need based on why they are riding them.\n\nHe said a lot of his customers are looking for lighter-weight bikes because triathalons are gaining in popularity.\n\nThese days, customers are finding Sumbaum not just by word of mouth, but also by the store's Facebook and Foursquare.\n\nIn addition, Sari said good weather drives his business.\n\n\"Our busy season has to be now,\" Sari said.\n\nIn addition, familes who are staying closer to home on break bring up business.\n\nSumbaum has lots of local customers, but the closest bicycle shop is at least 15 miles away, so they have a large base of customers.\n\n\"We draw from all over,\" Sari said.\n\n\n\nMr. Joliet August 22, 2012 at 01:52 PM\nTed Sari and his family are great people.

Then, Eva Longoria visited the hospital after hitting her head on the set of \"Desperate Housewives.\"\n\nBoth are recovering from their injuries.\n\nWhile most people have health insurance to cover medical costs, celebrities -- who have so much riding on their physical appearance -- often have extra insurance policies, sometimes just on specific \"assets.\"\n\nBetty Grable started the trend of insuring individual body parts when she insured her legs for $1 million in 1940. Since then, celebs from dancer-actor Fred Astaire to singer-actress Dolly Parton have had one body part or another covered by a policy.\n\nThe trend of insuring one part of the body has faded in favor of insuring the entire person, but there are several celebs who have put a premium on one particular part in the past:\n\n\u2022 Astaire insured his legs for $75,000 apiece and his wrists and arms for $20,000\n\n\u2022 Parton's breasts are insured for $600,000\n\n\u2022 Former baseball player Mark McGwire's ankle was insured during his record-setting season\n\n\u2022 Model Heidi Klum's legs were insured for a one-shot ad\n\n\u2022 Musicians who reputedly insured their voices: Bob Dylan, Rod Stewart, Bruce Springsteen (for $6 million) and the Beatles\n\nWhile there are no estimates on how much a policy on Longoria's head might be, a representative from Accordia Insurance estimated a premium for the \"Desperate Housewives\" star is probably around $15,000 a year. That figure is to protect the production company from the loss of services of the actress, because it can cost between $75,000 (TV movie) and $400,000 (feature) to rearrange a shooting schedule.\n\nThe Accordia representative said that amount skyrockets when a show goes into syndication, because the financial stakes of a long-running show are much higher.\n\nOften, production companies take out life insurance on key cast members. The policy on insuring a lynchpin stars, such as Kelsey Grammer of \"Frasier,\" could be worth as much as $50 million to $100 million, because his loss would have such a great impact on the long-term financial worth of the show.\n\nMost films and TV shows take out cast insurance. One insurance company estimated that for \"Desperate Housewives,\" the premium could run anywhere from $75,000 to $100,000 to cover the entire cast.\n\nFeature film insurance can run to $1 million for the entire cast for a movie with a $50 million budget.

No matter which Democrat is selected to carry the party\u2019s banner this fall, the attacks on \u201ccharacter\u201d, \u201cexperience\u201d and everything under the sun except what really matters will grow more intense and more ridiculous. Is this any way to select the person who will preside over the largest military and economy in the world? Hell no.\n\nFor those who have followed my scribbling on this site about the campaign, you know I originally picked Dennis Kucinich because he was right on the issues that matter. When he dropped out of the campaign (I refuse to call it a \u201crace\u201d for what I hope are obvious reasons) I resorted to WWJVF \u2013 \u201cWho would Jesus vote for\u201d as my test and joined those favoring Barrack Obama.\n\nI have, however, been increasingly disappointed by the horrid way in which this campaign has gone. Sen. Clinton has made me wonder whether the right wing cabal against her husband and herself during his Presidency weren\u2019t more correct than it appeared. Sen. Obama has not descended quite as far, but he is also not saying a whole lot about what I think really matters, so I am going to lay out what I think are the some real issues that receive scant attention.\n\n1. Will you as President renounce and reject the doctrine of pre-emptive war? It is so fundamentally opposed to the very essence of our national history that to not completely reject this policy of the Bush administration will leave us permanently exposed to other misadventures and ultimately our extinction.\n\n2. Will you as President renounce and reject the so-called \u201cunitary executive\u201d theory and its bastard child \u201csigning statements.\u201d? The genius of the Constitution was the creation of a tripartite system with each branch balancing the other. We are not at war. We do not want need nor can we suffer a dictator under the guise of a \u201ccommander in chief.\u201d\n\n3. Will you as President bring our budget back to balance by:\na. Reducing military spending by 30%, including a reduction in \u201cforeign aid\u201d that is really military spending, such as to Israel and Columbia.\nb. vetoing any legislation containing earmarks\nc.

Bush and his \u201cPeople\u201d started lying early in the 2000 primary race and has been lying, abusing his Presidential powers and the the constitution every since and have never had to face the music for doing so\u2026There should be some punishment enacted before they leave office in order to scare hell out of any future president who even thinks about pulling the same crap.\n\n    Bravo to Phil for the article and to: pollchecker, austin, and old curmudgeon for their great additions..thanks!\n\n  4. SEAL \u00a0April 4, 2008 at 7:15 pm\n\n    The president can initiate and support any or all of the obvious bills to make the necessary changes in the way our goverment conducts itself. But that would require our house and senate members to put in a 40 hour work week 50 times a year.\n\n    Imagine the good things they could do if they would just show up for work\n\n  5. Charlie Couser \u00a0April 4, 2008 at 7:54 pm\n\n    * Term limits! Our Fore Fathers envisioned that those elected to federal office should \u2018service\u2019 their country for a specific period of time and not become entrenched in it. Career politicians are a cancer that eats away at the system. One six (6) year term for the senate and two (2) four (4) year terms for the house should do it. If they haven\u2019t accomplished their goals by then, they ain\u2019t gonna\u2026\n\n    * No lobbyists and no special interest legislation! Again, our Fore fathers envisioned a government \u2018\u2026of the people, by the people and for the people\u2026 .\u2019 They did not mention a government \u2018\u2026of big business, by big business and for big business\u2026 .\u2019\n\n    Charlie Couser\n\n  6.

And how about THE BIGGIE:\n\n    Q.) Are you, as President, going to continue to aid and abet the occupation, theft and destruction of Palestine for the sake of Old Testament prophecy and the Chosen People, or will you join every other country in standing up to racism and fundamentalist nationalism, for the sake of survival of the planet?\n\n  8. ekaton \u00a0April 7, 2008 at 5:17 pm\n\n    One six year term for the senate.\n    One four year term for representatives.\n    One two year term for president.\n    The president is the least necessary to the republic as that position is one of law enforcement only. This includes signing bills into law (NO SIGNING STATEMENTS ALLOWED) or vetoing them only. Bush and previous presidents have usurped way too much power. And NO military action EVER unless WAR is DECLARED by a 2/3 majority CONGRESS, and thats BOTH houses, 2/3 in each.\n\n    On more than one occasion Bush has stated as justification for his signing statements that purport to state which parts of a law he will enforce or ignore, that it is the president\u2019s job to interpret the law. No one has ever called him on this. (Do I really need to tell you whose job it is to interpret the law?)\n\n    \u2013Kent Shaw\n\n  9.

Dr.D \u00a0April 8, 2008 at 1:50 am\n\n    I agree 100% about getting rid of signing statements,but what about executive orders? They should be outlawed too.And if we really want to return to our original system fashioned by the founding fathers,it would also be necessary to repeal the 17th amendment and return senatorial seats to the control of the respective state legislatures.Senators should be legally bound to represent their respective state legislatures,and not just redundant components like they are in our current\u2019free agent\u2019system.\n    While we\u2019re at it,repeal of the 16th amendment would be a real good idea too,since it flies in the face of the original constitution. Ed\n\n  12. ekaton \u00a0April 8, 2008 at 9:31 am\n\n    Dr. D,\n\n    Yes, executive orders also. Would\u2019ve mentioned that if I\u2019d thought of it. And, I believe neither the 16th nor the 17th were properly ratified, so they don\u2019t need to be repealed, we just need the government to stop illegally enforcing them.\n\n    \u2013 Kent Shaw\n\n  13. Flapsaddle \u00a0April 8, 2008 at 11:10 am\n\n    Some of these will fly and some will explode while taxiing out of the hangar:\n\n    1. When Congress grows a pair and stops handing the President a blank check for these \u201csplendid little wars\u201d without Congress exercising its duty. Blame Harry Truman for starting the trend.\n\n    2. Congress needs a bigger pair. It needs to stop trying to usurp executive authority and reclaim the congressional authority usurped by executives over the last 60 years.\n\n    3. It is the job of Congress job to control the budget, it is not the job of the President. Thank FDR for beginning the modern tradition of telling Congress what it must do.\n\n    4. The Senate needs to reassert its authority on \u201cadvice and consent\u201d to treaties, and Congress needs to reform tax laws that allow corporations to \u201coff-shore\u201d otherwise taxable returns.\n\n    5. Absolutely, positively and immediately!\n\n    6. The Feds have no more business in this than it has in controlling education.\n\n    7. The power to restrict the class of cases that the USSC reviews is available to Congress; they need to use it.\n\n    What many people seem to forget is that it was/is the so-called \u201cprogressive\u201d element of the left-leaning that has over the last 70 years encouraged and approved the land-grab of the executive for authority.\n\n    Most sincerely,\n\n    T.

Body Language?\n\n    I mean if all politicians are liars who will say whatever it takes to be elected, then wouldn\u2019t they just give you the answers that they think you want to hear?\n\n    Does it matter what we ask if they are only go to lie and then do as they please like George W did.\n\n  15. old_curmudgeon \u00a0April 4, 2008 at 9:34 am\n\n    8. Commit to beginning War Crimes trials for Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld, Powell, Rice, Sanchez, Abizaid, Pace, Feith, Wolfowitz, et. al. I could go on\u2026 The only way the United States is going to regain it\u2019s moral standing in the world view is to bring those responsible for the invasion of a sovereign nation to trial.

Stratocaster \u00a0April 4, 2008 at 11:37 am\n\n    Does a democracy need a president or would it be better off without one? In order for a democracy to work its president has to have very limited power. If the president has limited power how is it that Dubya managed to singlehandedly get more than 4000 Americans killed, bankrupt the country, and destroy my civil rights?\n\n  22. pollchecker \u00a0April 4, 2008 at 1:10 pm\n\n    I would like to point out that the United States of America is a Republic that uses a Democracy to elect its representatives.\n\n    That said\u2026..this does not invalidate your comments.\n\n  23. calico_jack \u00a0April 4, 2008 at 11:44 am\n\n    I disagree with a national primary day. It gives too great an advantage to the establishment candidates such as Hillary Clinton. Someone like Obama never could have had a chance if he would have had to campaign everywhere on one day. I think a good reform would be rotating regional primaries. Divide the country into regions (New england, Mid atlantic, Southeast, midwest, pacific coast, southwest) and have each region vote on a different day. Then every primary period the order is changed so each region gets to vote early once in awhile.\n\nComments are closed."}

I have a question regarding the Holy Spirit.\u00a0 I believe as you do that when we became saved God sealed the Holy Spirit within us.\u00a0 However, this confuses me at times.\u00a0 My question is:\u00a0 If the Holy Spirit is God and God can have no part in sinning, how can the Holy Spirit stay in us while we are sinning?\u00a0 Does the Holy Spirit leave us while we are sinning then return when we repent?\u00a0 If so how can the Holy Spirit be sealed in me if it leaves me while I am sinning?\n\nA. You\u2019ve hit on one of the most remarkable characteristics of God\u2019s grace, and that\u2019s His decision to see us not as we are but as we will be when we\u2019re perfected. 2 Cor. 5:17 says that from God\u2019s perspective we\u2019re already a new creation, that the old is gone and the new has come.\u00a0\u00a0 2 Cor. 5:21 says that because of the Son\u2019s sacrifice the Father sees us as being as righteous as He is.\u00a0 In Romans 7:20 Paul wrote that when he sinned God knew that it wasn\u2019t him but the sin living in him that was to blame.\n\nI heard one teacher explain Romans 8:29 to mean that when God looks at us it\u2019s through the image of His Son, so He sees only that part of us that conforms to the Son\u2019s image.\n\nIn three different places Paul said that the Holy Spirit is sealed within us.\u00a0 He can\u2019t leave no matter what.\u00a0 The best I can tell you is that where we\u2019re concerned God is the ultimate expert at separating the believer from the behavior.\n\nPrint Friendly"}

{"dataman_score": 3.0, "text": "Social services considering an exorcism \u2013 in the name of child\u00a0protection?\n\nI found this via the blog of Maryam Namazie: the social services in Islington seriously considered sending a child back to the Democratic Republic of the Congo for an exorcism. Yes, that\u2019s right, for an exorcism.\n\nExorcisms are a load of shite. I don\u2019t care if people believe them or not; what I do care about is people being harmed because they\u2019re \u201cpossessed\u201d by a supernatural entity for which the only evidence is a person who is behaving strangely, when said strange behaviour is far more likely to be be the result of an epileptic seizure, or being schizophrenic or autistic. Here\u2019s a section from the article I linked:\n\nThe deliverance that the boy was to undergo would have involved starving him of food and fluids for three days.\n\nAt the end of the fasting period, he would be surrounded by the deliverance team who would pray over him and command the evil spirit to be cast out of the child. When deliverance takes place, the child vomits up the \u201csorcery bread\u201d that has been infecting him.\n\nDr Hoskins also met the pastor from the Pentecostal church attended by the grandparents, who warned that if the evil spirits were not dealt with, they would cause \u201cstrife, illness, divorce, hardship, poverty and death\u201d.\n\nThe pastor claimed that the boy would have sorcery tools to perform magic with, such as mirrors, brushes, sticks and string, and warned that these would have to be confiscated.\n\nDr Hoskins asked whether the boy would be beaten, and was assured that this was not part of the normal deliverance process. However, when he was presented with a boy who had recently undergone the ordeal, he found the child \u201cscared and traumatised\u201d.\n\nStarving a child for three days sounds like child abuse to me. And it gets worse: in that article, the expert they sent mentioned that some children are beaten, shaken repeatedly, have chilli pepper rubbed into them or even being cut with razor blades. That is definitely abuse, and it should be called out as such, regardless of the religion: whether Pentecostal, as in this case, or Catholic or any other form of Christianity, or Judaism or Islam\u2026I don\u2019t care what it is. The right to freedom of belief or disbelief ends when it starts to hurt somebody else.\n\nTags: , , ,\n\nAbout Philip\n\n\nAny comments?\n\n\nYou are commenting using your account.

Our room lighting isn't bright, but it lights the place up and I imagine the lighting also has an affect on how responsive the device is.\n\nIf you've calibrated and lit your room but notice some lag, try closing the curtains because perhaps there is some other light affecting your Kinects sensor.\n\nI thought more about how this could be better and some kind of button control for FPS and similar, perhaps a glove control like in Minority Report?\n\nI'm impressed, I love the Wii and I'm an old school Mario fan, but this tops it. Joyride is comparable to Mario Kart.\n\nI just hope there are a lot more innovations and games to come. :-)\n\n\u00a0MS's new controller, is it any good?\n\n| | See all techwondo's reviews (3)\n\nI waited at my local Asda for an hour last night to get this and after eagerly handing over the money, i rushed home to try it out.\n\nThe packaging was average and i found that because i had treat my 360 well (and as such i was running an early 360) i was rewarded with the faff of an aditional adaptor.\n\nAfter the firmware update - which was quite slow to download bespite having a very fast BB connection - i finally had a working Kinect... well, once i had cleared an enormous amount of room space and added more lighting. I see why they have large, wide open, overlit spaces in the adverts. But thats a small price to pay.\n\nI suppose the control of the dashboard is ok, although not very intuative to start with. However, Kinect isnt about dashboard control, its about game control.\n\nIm sorry to say that despite what you may have heard, this is far from the next generation of game control. Even allowing for the fact that this is new technology to MS, its still noticably laggy and lacks the precision of Playstation's Move or even the Wii's wimote, due to the (by modern standards) lower resolution camera. Its also obvious how much processing power this device requires to make it work, which brings me on to the next part...\n\nThe game its self plays like a graphicaly enhanced Wii game, with all the inherant flaws there in. It then dawned on me, that this is a very limited controller, in terms of the games you could play. There are no buttons, so any action must only be gesture related. This may work acceptably for puzzle or maybe driving games but it certainly wont work for RPGs or FPSs.\n\nIn summary, its an expensive accessory (let's not be shy about it, its nearly the price of a new console), which needs a quite specific environment to work in and has limited use/functionality for the average gamer. Yes, the technology is interesting but its technology for technology's sake.\n\nThis control system is slightly behind the wimote and, sadly, miles behind the Playstations Move controller.\n\n\u00a0Its a pretty average controller at a very expensive price\n\n| | See all Shock1's reviews (1)\n\nThe concept certainly isn't new, The playstation 2 with the eyetoy was the first console to introduce controller free gaming using a camera. Of course the technology is now updated with the xbox360, but is it worth 130 pounds?\n\nTo be quite frank no, most commentators are hoping firmware updates will fix the faults, unfortunately the kinect uses a very low resolution sensor, so it will never get better at sensing / detecting, firmware cant upgrade hardware. It will always be quite imprecise and will always be quite laggy. The camera itself apparently costs around 35 pounds to make, so there is quite a heavy mark up for the price as well.\n\nThere is a reason both Nintendo and Sony turned this technology down, you are the controller, but with no controller you are left to run on the spot to actually run you have no buttons so have no way of firing weapons or using tools.. Its great for dancing and excercise, for anything else its mediocrity at its finest and will probably drop down in price quite heavily after christmas.\n\n\u00a0On the fence still.\n\n| | See all capnAlrd's reviews (3)\n\nThe technology behind Kinect is impressive and it has the potential to deliver entirely unique experiences that the several motion camera experiments that have already been made for video games consoles never could have come close to. The issue is that none of the games are attempting to offer a compelling experience and Microsoft is doing everything to make their core base of gamers feel excluded from the experience.\n\nMy honest suggestion for those who are still on the fence is to wait it out until next year (when the bigger releases pile on; Kinect Star Wars, etc.). Because right now there is certainly no rush to buy this (that is, if you're into motion controls in the first place). No game release as of yet is going to make you certainly rush to the shops just to buy the Kinect.\n\nMy concern is finding out how well the Kinect will do in the games department months down the line. Will it continue to give us shovelware like the Wii did? Or will it, in time, bring better and brighter experiences in the gaming world. It's hard to say.\n\n\u00a0You can only fully appreciate the fun with a Kinect party!\n\n| | See all ArthurJackson's reviews (4)\n\nI'm not reviewing the technology of Kinect, I'm just going to say how much FUN it is! In addition to the supplied Adventures games, we bought Kinect Sports and Dance Central and invited a few friends around to play it. There were seven of us, male, female, ages ranging from 23 to 61, some of whom had no previous interest in video games. It was an absolute hoot, everybody had a go. It's a long time since we all laughed together so much! It's definitely not just for children, it's for anybody who has an inner child and doesn't mind making a fool of themselves.

The bigger and better teams in our conference just killed us in those two areas and that\u2019s where we\u2019re going to need to get better if we are to get to where we want to be.\u201d\n\nThe first step taken to shore things up in the paint started with the recruitment of three promising new players that fit the profile.\n\nThe additions of Tequila Lloyd, Misha Green and Devona Paul promises to add some much-needed size and depth to the Cardinals\u2019 roster.\n\n\u201cWe knew we needed to get bigger and stronger inside and I think those three new players have the skill base and potential to really help us out there,\u201d Cole said. \u201cOnly time will tell but, with the players we have coming back and the addition of those players as well as with the new level of focus on defense and rebounding I think we have the nucleus of a very good team this year.\u201d\n\nA good recruitment class isn\u2019t the only reason for more than just a little cautious optimism. Plattsburgh also returns virtually its entire roster from a year ago, including Payne and Marshall who have already established themselves as elite players in the SUNYAC. Both have made their marks in a major way in the early portion of their respective collegiate careers.\n\nPayne led the SUNYAC in scoring for the majority of her sophomore season on her way to shattering her school\u2019s all-time single-season scoring mark. Marshall, for her part, wasted no time establishing herself as one of the conference\u2019s premiere playmakers and 3-point shooters as just a freshman. Those two, combined with a solid supporting cast, could fuel another solid season for the Cardinals.\n\n\u201cWhat I really like is the way some of our upperclassmen, especially the seniors, have stepped up,\u201d Cole said. \u201cThey\u2019ve come to camp focused and in shape and have already established themselves as leaders on this team. For many of these ladies this is it, they realize it\u2019s time to really step it up and, so far anyways, they\u2019ve done that.\u201d\n\nPlattsburgh will open its 2012-2013 campaign against a Sage squad that just might be out for some measure of revenge.\n\n\u201cThat was just a strange game,\u201d said Cole, referring to last year\u2019s somewhat lopsided victory. \u201cIt was just one of those nights when everything we put up, no matter who was shooting it, it went in. We just couldn\u2019t miss that night. We shot the ball better that night than we had all year. It was fun but you just can\u2019t expect results like that every night.\u201d\n\nCole would take another offensive explosion but realistically expects tonight\u2019s matchup to be an entirely different story one year later.\n\n\u201cYou can bet that they haven\u2019t forgotten how that felt,\u201d said Cole, referring to last year\u2019s contest. \u201cIt\u2019s a new season and they are going to be at home. I am definitely expecting a battle. Hopefully, we can match their energy and intensity, especially early on and get our season off to a good start.\u201d\n\nAfter tonight\u2019s nonconference opener, Plattsburgh will face Middlebury College a week from Sunday in its home opener at Memorial Hall.\n\n\nPlattsburgh State University Cardinals 2012-2013\n\nWomen's Basketball Roster\n\nNo. Name Pos.

How utterly exciting! I applaud your reasoning for hiring him \u2013 excellent writing skills are proof of a good brain and that\u2019s a requirement for someone telling you what to do. I will be locked onto your blog from here on in (not that I wasn\u2019t already, but now I\u2019ll be drooling, too).\n\n    Interesting that he\u2019s doing away with doubles, I\u2019m curious to see how you\u2019ll like that. I never did know if you enjoyed doing doubles or if it was just something you accepted. They always sound chore-like to me, so I\u2019d be thrilled with no doubles, but then\u2026I\u2019m nowhere near your mileage level yet, so that\u2019s only conjecture on my part.\n\n    Anyway, congrats on the choice, I\u2019m sure it was the smartest think you could do at this point and the quickest way to new heights. Woohoo!\n\n  2. Don\u2019t get me wrong \u2014 there will be doubles, just not nearly daily like I was doing. About a month from now, I\u2019ll be doing doubles once or twice a week (because that\u2019s probably the only way to safely get the mileage up there).\n\n    And remember that this is just basebuilding (which is a little frightening, considering that I\u2019ve got three+ \u201cquality\u201d days a week to look forward to). Apparently more doubles are on the horizon when we get toward the peak of training in the spring.\n\n    The best time to try doubles, I think, is when you\u2019re running relatively low mileage. See if you like it before assuming that you won\u2019t.\n\n  3. I didn\u2019t even realize this was basebuilding. Wow! Three quality days is going to make you one super strong woman by the time peak rolls around! I can\u2019t wait to train vicariously through you.\n\n    Smart advice on the doubles. I\u2019m inherently lazy so we\u2019ll see how much mileage I ever get to. I know if I ever want to do anything interesting, I\u2019ll have to, but if running becomes a grind (my fear), I\u2019ll settle with mediocre mileage. :-)\n\n    What\u2019s your feeling on high mileage living? Has it been enjoyable for the most part?\n\n  4. Well, I\u2019d much rather engage in high income living, but high mileage living is okay. It was tough this summer, because I\u2019m just one of those people who doesn\u2019t run well in heat and humidity. I love running in the cold, so I\u2019m chuffed to get up to 90 mpw again in the dead of winter.\n\n    High mileage, if it doesn\u2019t injure or exhaust you, is better than not running enough miles. That\u2019s why I\u2019m doing it. I know it can take years to get completely adjusted to it and reap the full benefits. That\u2019s where the \u201cenjoyment\u201d will come in, for the most part.\n\n    I did get used to running twice a day and came to look forward to its head-clearing properties. But I\u2019m enjoying having one longer run \u2014 I love a good 8-12 miler before work, and with this plan, my wish is granted more days than not.\n\n  5. From what I know of him, you\u2019ve made a good choice. The big thing is trusting the coach, trusting their training philosophy, and being willing to put yourself in their hands.\n\n    Give him detailed honest feedback on how you\u2019re feeling; coping with the sessions and weeks. I think you\u2019ll do well. Better with Kevin than the Russian!\n\n    My one experience with being coached was positive (I selected a good coach) \u2013 most of my PBs were run at that time of my running life.\n\n  6. Verry good choiche you make for training, good luck!.\n    Groet Rinus.\n\n  7. [...] run faster! You\u2019re fitter now!\u201d I know that it\u2019s the mileage plus faster running over the past eight weeks that led to this bump in fitness. What\u2019s interesting is how such advancements sometimes make [...]\n\n  8. [...] Two years ago,\u00a0 I hired my first coach. I was still on a post-race high from running 3:19 at Steamtown. I also had a cold. [...]\n\nLeave a Reply\n\n\nYou are commenting using your account.

Nazi pictures. Lots of these were being sold inside along with lots of Nazi memoribilia.\n\nPerson3: I was listening to this lady this morning saying we didn't understand the Tea Parties. What the boston tea party was all about. Therefor we are a bunch of anti-Democrat, Racist, Tea-baggers.\n\nPerson4: We as a nation, as normal citizens - we can be rounded up and put into these FEMA Camps. The fencing around them, the barbed wire, is designed to keep those in. They're just preparing for the future where they anticipate civil riots.\n\nPerson5: Well they have the FEMA Camps, and they have these things all set in place - when they start imprisoning people, and people start seeing the we are the \"enemy\", that will make it hot.\n\nPerson4: In fact, Obama's own campaign promise was that he would build up a 20,000 man civil army to patrol the streets of America that will be stronger than our own military.\n\nLet me just state up front that I happen to be very strongly pro 2nd Amendment. I also happen to like the 1st, 4th, 5th and 8th Amendments quite a bit too. I believe that if we properly work to protect and strengthen all of these principles, the need to exercise the 2nd Amendment - the Amendment of last desperate resort against a truly tyrannical government - becomes essentially moot.\n\nBut these people don't seem to understand that. It's probably unfair to paint with a broadbrush and Garafalo everyone shown here, but it's also true that every bunch is likely to have more than a couple bad apples.\n\nBad Apples like Josh Cartwright.\n\n\nA few minutes after he killed the deputies, Cartwright was himself killed in a shootout with lawmen in DeFuniak Springs [...]\n\n\nFar from being a blanket \"attack on conservatives\" it seems that in the immediate wake of Cartwright and other Right-Wing Domestic Terrorists such as James Adkisson (Shot 5, killed 2 \"Liberals\" in Knoxville, TN), Richard Poplawski (Killed 2 Cops in Pittsburgh) and James Cummings (Attempted Maine \"Dirty Bomber\") - the Homeland Security Report on \"Right-Wing Extremists\" may have been right on the money.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with owning a gun and using it responsibly.\n\nBut when you subscribe to full-on nutbag conspiracy theories about the duly elected President, combined with extreme personal stress - the results can become a danger to us all.\n\nJust remember that many of the people shown by Blumenthal are the same people interviewed here by Alexandra Pelosi in \"Right America: Feeling Wronged\".\n\nWe ignore them, at all of our peril.\n\n\nFriday, May 1\n\nScheuer vs ACLU : Prosecute Clinton for Rendition\n\nApproximately 8 mins into this discussion on the CIA use of Torture, former CIA Bin Laden Desk Chief Micheal Scheuer (Author of Imperial Hubris) argues that prosecuting Bush Officials for torture would \"tear this country apart\", and that if this is attempted - it should go even further into prosecutions against Bill Clinton for the Rendition Program that he setup which was run my Scheuer himself.\n\nIt's classic bait and switch, tar and feather the hated opposition for shoplifting a donut while hiding the stolen Queen Mary behind your back. \"Look over there - A Bird!\"\n\nIn the meantime he makes every possible wingnut argument, many of whom I thoroughly debunked last week when they were parroted by Liz Cheney. Scheuer's a smart guy, and clearly the world's leading expert on Bin Laden, but he's also a raging Clinton-Hater and budding Barack-No-Phobe, so his comments on either of them have to be taken with a Back-Hoe of Salt.\n\n\nThursday, April 30\n\nUnraveling the Criminal Torture Conspiracy\n\nWith the release of the Yoo/Bybee memos and the Armed Services Committee report much has been made lately of the involvement of top U.S. Officials in the use of techniques which could be considered Torture.\n\nJohn Yoo has blasted Obama for release of these memos. Jay Baybee has argued that his conclusions represent a \"Good Faith\" analysis of the law. But does it?\n\nIs this simply a matter of a difference in policy, a difference in legal opinion and perspective or is it something far worse? Where these memos and conclusions specifically requested and provided to enable the execution of War Crimes and Torture?\n\n\nBesides the individual acts which have been well documented as occurring in various detention facilities world-wide the real question is whether or not a Criminal Conspiracy Case could potentially be brought against Bush Administration Officials, and if so, which ones?\n\nTo determine this we must look at the chain of evidence we have so far.\n\nThe first official action begins with this Jan 9, 2002 Memo (pdf) from John Yoo to William J. Haynes, General Counsel for the DoD which argues that Geneva does not apply to Taliban Fighters in Afghanistan.\nYou have asked for our Office's views concerning the effect of international treaties and federal laws on the treatment of individuals detained by the U.S. Armed Forces during the conflict in Afghanistan. In particular, you have asked whether the laws of armed conflict apply to the conditions of detention and the procedures for trial of member of al Qeada and the Taliban militia. We conclude that these treates do not protect members of the al Qeada organization, which as a non-State actor cannot be a party to the international agreements governing war. We further conclude that that [sic] these treaties do not apply to the Taliban militia. This memorandum expresses no view as to whether the President should decide, as a matter of policy, tha tht U.S. Armed Forces should adhere to the standards of conduct in those treaties with respect to the treatment of prisoners.\nIt may be important to note that this memo does not recommend deviating from the standing rules contained in the Army Field Manual (which comports with Geneva). George Bush applied this rationale and denied POW status to the Taliban on Jan 18th. It's interesting to note how this relatively neutral argument that Geneva doesn't apply to AQ & Taliban was amped up to a whole new level by this following memo from Alberto Gonzales on Jan 25th (pdf) which provided his recommendation on whether to reverse the Jan 18th decision and voluntarily abide by Geneva (accepting the assumption that it didn't apply) or not.\n\nPositives (to denying Geneva protections)\n\nFlexibility: In my judgment this new paradigm renders Geneva's strict limitations on questioning of enemy prisoners and renders quaint some of it's provisions requiring that captured enemy be afforded such things as commissary privileges, scrip (i.e., advances of monthly pay), athletic uniforms and scientific instruments.\n\n\no That statute, enacted in 1996; prohibits the commission of a \"war crime\" by or against a U.S. person, including U.S. officials. \"War Crime\" for these purposes is defined to include any grave breach of GPW (Geneva POW Conventions) or any violation of common Article 3 thereof (such as \"outrages against personal dignity\"). Some of these provisions apply (if the GPW applies) regardless of whether the individual being detained qualifies as a POW. Punishments for violations of Section 2441 Include the death penalty. A determination that the GPW is not applicable to the Taliban would mean that Section 2441 would not apply to actions taken with respect to the Taliban.\n\no Adhering to your determination that GPW does not apply would guard effectively against misconstruction or misapplication of Section 2441 for several reasons. First, some of the language of the GPW is undefined (it prohibits, for example, \"outrages upon personal dignity\" and \"inhuman treatment\") and it is difficult to predict with confidence what actions might be deemed to constitute violations of the relevant provisions of GPW. Second, it is difficult to predict the needs and circumstances that could arise in the course of the war on terrorism. Third, it is difficult to predict the motives of prosecutors and independent counsels who may in the future decide to pursue unwarranted charges based on Section 2441. Your determination would create a reasonable basis in law that Section 2441 does not apply, which would provide a solid defense against any future prosecution.\n\nReading this is like reading a note from a mob lawyer to his client describing how to commit murder and get away with it! First of all, it's clear from this memo that Gonzales isn't making an argument that various techniques are or aren't a potential breach, he's attempting to \"maintain flexibility\" to use options \"outside the box\" and NOT GET PROSECUTED FOR IT. This indicates a knowing awareness that he feels that the law, as strictly written may appear to be violated, and that his recommendation to deny Geneva Protections is as much driven by a desire to avoid the death penalty as to pursue the war. Secondly, what is or isn't a \"War Crime\" and permisable in treating detainees, isn't \"difficult to predict\" at all - it has long been outlined in the Army Field Manual and the Uniform Code of Military Justice which considers any \"Maltreatment\" of a detainee to be a Courts Martial Offense.\n\nUCMJ Article 93.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Army Field Manual, which is designed to be consistent with Geneva, contains a LIST of prohibited interrogations techniques, which specifically includes Waterboarding!\n\n5-75. If used in conjunction with intelligence interrogations,\nprohibited actions include, but are not limited to\u2014\nsexual manner.\nover the eyes.\n\u2022 \u201cWaterboarding.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Using military working dogs.\n\u2022 Inducing hypothermia or heat injury.\n\u2022 Conducting mock executions.\n5-76. While using legitimate interrogation techniques, certain applications of\napproaches and techniques may approach the line between permissible\nactions and prohibited actions.\n\nLogic dictates that all of these techniques likely \"Maltreatment\" under the UCMJ, but are they War Crimes? The 4th Geneva Convention defines \"Grave Breaches\" as the following:\n\n\nSo even if you ignore the torture and coercive actions prohibited under the AFM and UCMJ, actions such as creating the Secure \"Black Sites\", and Extraordinary Renditions which were implemented are themselves Grave Breaches of Geneva and War Crimes.\n\nBy the way, exactly when did the President gain the power to \"Establish Law\"? Constitutionally that is a power given exclusively to Congress, while the Judiciary has the power to interpret the law in regards to the Constitution. Certainly there may be grey areas where legal analysis needs to be made by the executive branch which is charged with enforcing the law - but this memo, and those that follow it - seem to deliberately ignore previous case law and previous judicial decisions in favor a predetermined outcome to violate Geneva and knowingly allow the commision of what would otherwise absolutely be considered War Crimes, up to and including torture.\n\nThis direction was followed despite the vocal objections of then Secretary of State Colin Powell and his Counsel William Howard Taft IV (pdf)\n\nThe President should know that a decision that the Conventions do apply is consistent with the plain language of the Conventions and the unvaried practice of the United States in introducing its forces into conflict over fifty years. It is consistent with the advice of DOS lawyers and, as far as is known, the position of every other party to the Conventions. It is consistent with UN Security Council Resolution 1193 affirming that \"All parties to the conflict (in Afghanistan) are bound to comply with their obligations under international humanitarian law and in particular the Geneva Conventions.\n\nIgnoring both Powell, Taft and relevant UN Security Council Resolutions, Bush signed a memo denying Article 3 protections to Al Qeada and the Taliban on Feb 7.\n\nAt this point in time the legal theory in effect as a result of Bush's decision is that since the Taliban and Al Qaeda are are not themselves recognized internationally as legitimate governments they are not included within Geneva, and even though America has the option of treating them in a manner that is consistent with Geneva - IT WILL NOT - therefore indicating that War Crimes CAN be committed against them.\n\nThe problem with this decision is that Geneva does cover them. First off, because the fact that they haven't signed the Treaty is irrelevant - since we have. Geneva Article II\n\n\n\nUnder Article IV, Militia's such as the Taliban are included under coverage.\n\n\nYou could also include them under Section A.6.\n\n\nAnd even if the Taliban - which even Gonzales in his memo called a \"Militia\" - were not covered by this Section, all potential combatants are covered in the following section.\n\nFurther the 4th Geneva Conventions also makes this point.\nIn other words, any non-American on a battle field is protected by the conventions once they become a captive or detainee. There is NO OTHER VALID INTERPRETATION of this document. This makes it crystal clear that the decision as to whether someone is a POW, Non-combatant or Criminal is not something that can be made with a blanket statement, it has to be determined in a case-by-case basis by a legal and competent tribunal. It's not something a President can decide with the stroke of a pen anymore than he can declare that bank-robbery will no longer be illegal with a signing statement, just because someone needs the money for their sick mother.\n\nWhy you committed the crime doesn't matter, particularly when under the UN Convention Against Torture, all arguments - such as those provided by Gonzales that these techniques may have provided \"useful information\" - are irrelevant.\nThe advice given by both Yoo and Gonzales to ignore Geneva and the State Dept. at this point were completely irrevocably invalid, and Gonzales own further argument concerning 2441 shows that this wasn't just a \"mistake\" - it was a deliberate attempt to avoid likely prosecution for an impending premeditated crime.\n\nIn March of 2002, one month later, Abu Zubaydah was captured by U.S. forces in Pakistan. He became the test case for this new policy, but although 2441 had essentially been neutered another U.S. law still presented a problem. 18 U.S. 2340 - Torture\n\nAccording to the FBI, Zubaydah cooperated and provided information which helped identify and capture both Khallid Sheik Mohammed and Jose Padilla during the following months, but as the Levin Reports shows, some members of the administration weren't hearing what they wanted to hear. They weren't hearing how Saddam Hussein was responsible for 9-11 and linked to Al Qeada. They decided Zubaydah was being uncooperative, and that Harsher Measures were needed. They looked to use techniques developed by the S.E.R.E. (the Torture Resistance Program developed by U.S. Special Forces after communist governments attempts to illicit false confessions from their citizens and our Troops) Not exactly a brilliant idea unless you want to gain false information.\n\nHardball w/Turley & Buchannan on Rice and the Legality of Torture\n\nIn May of 2002 Condoleeza Rice advised George Tenet that S.E.R.E developed techniques such as Waterboarding could be used on Zubaydah and other high-value Al Qeada detainees. At this point in time although Geneva was effectively disabled, 18 USC 2340 was still in effect.\n\nIn order to address this problem another OLC memo from Jay Baybee was issued which attempted to redefine torture literally out of existence. It claimed 10 techniques (attention grasp, wailing, facial hold, facial slap, cramped confinement, wall standing, stress positions, sleep deprivations, insects place in a confinement box and the waterboard) would not cause severe physical or mental pain.\n\nIn this memo Bybee argued:\n\nThe goal of the facial slap is not to inflict physical pain that is severe or lasting. Instead, the purpose of the facial slap is to induce shock, surprise, and/or humiliation. Wall standing is used to induce muscle fatigue. The individual stands about four to fie feet from a wall, with his feet spread approximately to shoulder width. His arms are stretched out in front of him, with his fingers resting on the wall. You have informed us that these positions are not design to produce the pain associated with contortions or twisting of the body, Rather somewhat like wailing, they are designed to produce the physical discomfort associated with muscle fatigue.\n\nYou have informed us that he (Zubaydah) appears to have a fear of insects. In particular, you would like to tell Zubaydah that you intend to place a stinging insect into the box with him. You would, however, place a harmless insect in the box) Finally, you would like to use a technique called the \"waterboard\". This causes an increase in carbon dioxide level in the individual's blood. This increase in the carbon dioxide level stimulates increased effort to breathe. This effort plus the cloth produced the perception of \"suffocation and incipient panic,\" i.e., the perception of drowning.\n\nAny pain associated with muscle fatigue is not of the intensity sufficient to amount to \"sever physical pain or suffering\" under the statute, nor, despite it's discomfort, can it be said to be difficult to endure. As we understand it, when the waterboard is used, the subject's body responds as if the subject were drowning--even though the subject is well aware that he is in fact not drowning. You have informed us that this procedure does not inflict actual physical harm. Thus, although the subject may experience the fear or panic associated with the feeling of drowning, the waterboard does not inflict physical pain.\nParsing through whether the pain is \"severe\" or not completely misses the point that pain is entirely subjective, and that with repetition and duration such techniques over time can indeed become torturous. \"Increased Carbon Dioxide\" and experiencing the \"sensation of drowning\" can spike a subjects blood pressure, induce a stroke or heart-attack. Prolonged stress position scan indeed cause muscle fatigue, but that fatigue can eventually induce renal failure and cause a subject kidneys' to shutdown - leading to death. Zubaydah was ultimately waterboarded 83 Times. Rather than seeking information from a broad array of medical information and opinion, Bybee clearly ignored a great deal of information on the effects of torture from sources such as Amnesty International and also completely ignored to objections of the experienced S.E.R.E. program operation themselves.\n\"The requirement to obtain information from an uncooperative source as quickly as possible -- in time to prevent, for example, an impending terrorist attack that could result in loss of life -- has been forwarded as a compelling argument for the use of torture,\" the document said. \"In essence, physical and/or psychological duress are viewed as an alternative to the more time-consuming conventional interrogation process. The error inherent in this line of thinking is the assumption that, through torture, the interrogator can extract reliable and accurate information. History and a consideration of human behavior would appear to refute this assumption.\"\n\nThere was no consideration within the National Security Council that the planned techniques stemmed from Chinese communist practices and had been deemed torture when employed against American personnel, the former administration official said. The U.S. military prosecuted its own troops for using waterboarding in the Philippines and tried Japanese officers on war crimes charges for its use against Americans and other allied nationals during World War II.\n\nThe reasoning in the JPRA document contrasted sharply with arguments being pressed at the time by current and former military psychologists in the SERE program, including James Mitchell and Bruce Jessen, who later formed a company that became a CIA contractor advising on interrogations. Both men declined to comment on their role in formulating interrogation policy. The JPRA attachment said the key deficiency of physical or psychological duress is the reliability and accuracy of the information gained. \"A subject in pain may provide an answer, any answer, or many answers in order to get the pain to stop,\" it said.\n\nAs it turns out most of the information that was received from Zubaydah after his waterboarding has been considered dubious at best by the FBI. The techniques employed against him were repeated against Khallid Sheik Mohammad who was ultimately waterboarded 183 times. In December of 2002 Donald Rumsfeld authorized the use of 15 similar \"aggressive techniques\" against detainees in GTMO and at Bagram AFB. Eventually these techniques were exported to Abu Ghraib by General Geoffrey Miller on Rumsfeld's order in an effort to \"Gitmo-ize\" it. Although \"Waterboarding\" was prohibited, the use of nudity, stress position, humiliation and dogs was included.\n\nAmnesty International on subsequent results in Iraq and Abu Ghraib\n\nThe world watched with horror, shock and outrage the graphic pictures of Iraqi prisoners being tortured in Abu Ghraib Prison. Prisoners were severely beaten and repeatedly sexually humiliated by US soldiers. They were forced to eat pork and drink alcohol. They were assaulted, threatened with rape, forced to masturbate in front of female soldiers, and forced to wear women's underwear. They were kept naked, sometimes for several days. They were also forced to walk like dogs on their hands and knees and bark like dogs. The US military investigation in Iraq headed by Major General Antonio Taguba found \"systemic\" and \"illegal abuse of detainees\" in Abu Ghraib Prison between August 2003 and February 2004, and concluded that soldiers had \"committed egregious acts and grave breaches of international law at Abu Ghraib\u2026\". Amnesty International condemned the latest reports of torture and ill-treatment of prisoners in Abu Ghraib as war crimes. The organization called on the US Government to fully investigate them in order to ensure that there is no impunity for anyone found responsible, regardless of position or rank.\n\nThe final nail in the coffin for Bybee's defenses is the condition that Zubaydah is in now after all of this \"not severe, not painful\" treatment.\n\n\n\n\nLet me reiterate that Zubaydah was only 31 years old when he was captured by U.S. Forces - he's not even 40 yet. It seems obvious that this was a crimnial act, particularly when the tapes of Zubaydah's inerrogations were illegally destroyed in violationi of a court order. Similar reports are that Jose Padilla - who is an American Citizen - has been rendered essentially catatonic with severe PTSD and memory loss by his treatment in U.S. custody.\n\nThe link from Yoo, to Gonzales, Bush, Bybee, Rice, Tenet, Rumsfeld and Gen Miller to Abu Ghraib is an unbroken chain. Potentially what could be called a chain conspiracy.\n\nConspiracy is the term for a broad category of crimes involving multiple actors coming together to engage in criminal activity. Specific federal anti-conspiracy statutes are found throughout federal law. The two key elements in proving a conspiracy are an agreement and an act in furtherance of the conspiracy by one of the actors:\n\n* A key element in prosecuting a defendant for conspiracy is proving the agreement. The agreement that forms the basis for conspiracy need not be written, oral, or even explicit, but is often inferred from the facts of the specific case. If the parties meet and reach an understanding to work for a common purpose, there is an agreement.\n* Most criminal conspiracy statutes also require that at least one of the parties has committed an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy.\n\nA chain conspiracy involves several parties as links in one long criminal chain. Defendants in chain conspiracies are responsible for the actions of all participants in the chain, even if they never met some of the other participants in the chain.\n\nAs I noted at the beginning of this discussion, Conspiracy under 2340 (Torture) is punishable to the same degree as the underlying crime. In this case estimates are currently that approx 35 detainees have died as the result of Homicide, most likely while being interrogated - that would mean, excluding the death penalty, up to 20 years in prison for each and all members of the conspiracy.\n\nOh, and by the way, ignorance of the law is No Excuse.\n\n\nAn RNC Ad from Opposite World\n\nHeres video from a now defunct RNC Ad campaign in response to Obama's First 100 Days.\n\"100 days ago, a man read a grand speech from a TelePrompter,\" the text at\nthe beginning of the RNC spot reads. \"What if the Teleprompter had accidentally\nswitched to reality-mode?\"\n\non HuffingtonPost\n\nBeyond pushing a greatest hits list of attacks on\nthe president, the video also provides a window into the anti-Obama anger that\nstill consumes much of the GOP. Chairman Michael Steele has been the target of\ncriticism from some senior party members who believe he hasn't gone far enough\nin attacking the White House's agenda.\n\nRice: If the Pres. Authorized it - It was Legal\n\nIn this clip from Young Turks, Condolezza Rice is asked by Standford students if she authorized Torture. Her answer was not one of finer oratorical moments.\n\nMonday, April 27\n\nAnother Crazed Cop-Killer with Baracknophobia\n\nSad to see this happening no matter the circumstances, but you can't ignore the fact WE TOLD YOU SO!\n\nFollowing the murderous gun-sprees of James Adkisson, and Richard Poplowski, plus that would-be Dirty-Bomber James Cummings - we now have murderer Josh Cartwright from Florida.\n\n\n\n\nThe only positive thing about this tragedy, as was predicted by the Homeland Security Report that Republicans still want Janet Napolitano to Resign over, is the fact that this guy was working alone and not part of any larger group that could have done far more damage than one lone, well-trained, well-armed and emotionally distraught and clearly disturbed Army Reservist could do.\n\nThank heaven for small favors, because fitting this description certainly aren't difficult to locate these days.\n\n\nYoung Turks explain why America Tortured\n\nIn this clip from the The Young Turks, Cenk Uygur, lays out a beautiful explaination of the findings of the Levin Report which explains exactly why - America perpetrated torture.\n\nIn this second section (available at he makes the connection between the use of techniques that the experts said - DID NOT - generate useful information and the desperate lust to pin 9-11 onto Saddam Hussein's back.\n\n\n\nWannabe?

But Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld insisted the job belonged to the CIA. We now know that Sept. 11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was waterboarded 183 times in one month. His interrogator, a former CIA colleague of mine, admits he had almost no training in the technique and knew nothing about how the cumulative effect of waterboarding might affect the quality of the information he was trying to extract.\n\n\nThe use of torture has come at huge costs to American credibility and the morale and psychology of our intelligence agencies. If we're going to pay those costs, we ought to know what we're getting. A thorough clearing of the air will help discredit the idea that we either torture terrorists or become victims. This false choice is played out on shows like 24, leaving people with the notion that had the FBI somehow caught one of the hijackers in the hours leading up to Sept. 11, torture would have led to the arrests of the 18 others before those planes took off. The truth is less sensational and more unsettling--but ultimately one that Americans should learn to accept. There are ticking time bombs out there. But torture won't get us any closer to discovering when they're going to go off."}

It works both ways,\" said lead researcher Dr. Xiaojing Ma, an Associate Professor in the Department of Microbiology and Immunology at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York City.\n\nHis team's findings are published in the Nov. 17 issue of Immunity.\n\nWhen bacteria, viruses or other invaders threaten cells, compounds called pro-inflammatory cytokines produced by the infected cells send out chemical signals that alert immune T-cells to ready themselves for battle. T-cells are primed to recognize \"the enemy\" by the presence of specific molecules, called antigens.\n\nHowever, scientists have long puzzled over the fact that, in some cases, T cells can remain dormant, even in the presence of these antigens.\n\n\"That's definitely what happens when the body's own cells die a natural death, through apoptosis \u2013 programmed cell death,\" Dr. Ma said.\n\nWhen cells reach the end of their natural lifespan, immune white blood cells called macrophages act as the main disposal units, \"eating up\" dead or dying cells.\n\nHowever, even though the macrophage releases antigens during this cleanup, T-cells keep quiet.\n\n\"That's a good thing, because you wouldn't want a big immune response in this case, triggering inflammatory symptoms such as aches and fever,\" Dr. Ma said.\n\nIn fact, runaway immune systems are the very heart of painful chronic conditions such as lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, and inflammatory bowel diseases like Crohn's. Scientists have been looking for decades for a way to short-circuit the immune response, as a means of easing these conditions.\n\nIn their investigation, Dr. Ma and his team looked closely at the activity of human and mouse macrophages using a variety of cellular and molecular tools.\n\nThey discovered that \"even though the activated macrophage presents the proper antigens as it eats up dead or dying cells, one particular pro-inflammatory cytokine, called interleukin 12 (IL-12) is not produced,\" according to Dr. Ma.\n\nIL-12 is a major factor that activates lymphocytes such as Natural Killer (NK) and T cells to fight off infection and eliminate cancerous cells. Without IL-12, the normal immune response is suppressed.\n\nDigging deeper, the Weill Cornell team discovered that cell-to-cell contact between the macrophage and the dying cell activates a novel protein called GC-binding protein (GC-BP), \"possibly through a specific receptor on the macrophage's surface,\" Dr. Ma said. GC-BP then undergoes a chemical change that allows it to enter into the nucleus of the macrophage.\n\nOnce there, the protein targets and switches off the gene responsible for IL-12 production.\n\nThe result: macrophage activity with suppressed immune response.\n\n\"We studied this in mouse and human cells, and it works the same way,\" Dr. Ma said. \"We were the first to identify GC-BP, which appears to be a key player in this natural immune-suppression system.\"\n\nThe discovery opens intriguing new pathways to understanding and fighting immune disorders.\n\n\"In some cases of autoimmune disease, maybe this process breaks down,\" Dr. Ma speculated. \"For instance, deficiencies in the 'clean-up' of dying cells have been linked to lupus for a long time. And IL-12 is so key to so many of these common immune disorders \u2013 if we could find out how to suppress or induce its expression, maybe we could find new treatments to fight diseases like lupus or rheumatoid arthritis.\"\n\nThe finding might even lead to treatments against diseases characterized by a severe weakening of the immune system, as happens during infection with HIV.\n\n\"One of the earliest events that take place when HIV enters the body by infecting macrophages is that IL-12 production is severely impaired. This has significant impact on the host's immune capacity. HIV subsequently infects T-cells and ultimately destroys them through a process similar to programmed cell death,\" Dr. Ma explained. \"In that case, then, we'd look for a way to spark immune system activation, not suppression, perhaps by blocking GC-BP.\"\n\nAll of this is a long way off, he stressed, \"but understanding the process is the first step.\"\n\n\"We believe that by understanding how the body controls the immune response, we can someday harness or mimic that process via drug therapy, to prevent or control disease.\"\n\nDr. Ma's co-researchers on this study include former Weill Cornell graduate student Dr. Sunjung Kim, now a postdoc at Columbia University; and Dr. Keith B. Elkon, Professor of Medicine and Immunology at the University of Washington, Seattle.\n\n  \u2022 Bookmark\n  \u2022 Print\n\n    Find a Doctor\n\nClick the button above or call\n1 877 NYP WELL\n\nTop of page"}

He's never met you, but he's certain of it. And he's not the least bit ashamed of his prejudice, either.\n\nMe, I'm hardly a true-red-white-and-blue Tea Partier (it's the social conservatism that puts me off, mainly[1]), but I know plenty and they're not the lynchin' sort; vast majority of 'em would spit at anyone who suggested skin color was a good criteria for judging a person's worth.\n\nNow, sadly, some few do think that's a fine, fine yardstick -- but then, so does the Honorable the Mister Andre Carson. Neither one excuses the other.\n\nAnd I've got no use for either. Grow up, dammit, and start judging people on the content of their character, much as I have you on yours, at least as demonstrated to date.\n\n(Perhaps the saddest part of this mess is that Andre Carson is an immensely likeable man when he's not waving a bloody shirt; if he'd abjure race-baiting and concentrate on reality-based issues, he'd have much to commend him, even for a Democrat. But don't hold your breath waiting for that to happen).\nYou wanna quote from a great orator? Try this one: \"A man's rights rest in three boxes. The ballot box, jury box and the cartridge box. Let no man be kept from the ballot box because of his color. Let no woman be kept from the ballot box because of her sex.\" I'm not sure if that's the first use of the \"boxes\" formulation but it's one of the earliest. Who said it? Fredrick Douglass. Some darned big shoes there, for any speaker who follows him.\n\n1. This comment led to a nice little Roseholme argument, with Tam pointing out that \"the\" Tea party is really a plural and that the movement was, at least originally, single-issue: TEA, Taxed Enough Already. She's right, though I maintain that many \"Tea\" organizations now find themselves flying the banner of social-conservative chat-show hosts. No matter which of us has the most accurate model of the current state of things, one fact remains: they're not a frikkin' mob of cross-burners, no matter how much the CBC would like for them to be.\n\n\nBC said...\n\nMy desire to see to see him dangling from a tree is due to his status as a member of Congress.\n\nI could care less what color the man's skin is.\n\nArt said...\n\nThe mission statement of the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation, Inc., of which the Hon. Andre Carson is a member ... \"Our mission is to advance the global black community by developing leaders, informing policy and educating the public.\"\n\nIt would only be racist if ya'll substituted \"white\" for \"black\" ... but I'm sure mine is a minority opinion.\n\nif he'd abjure race-baiting\nAhhh ... If only Don Rickles had gone into politics.\n\nTam said...\n\nThe Tea Party Movement has nothing to do with social conservatism. While it is true that many who would describe themselves as Tea Partiers are social conservatives, the very name is an acronym for \"Taxed Enough Already\".\n\nDon't let the MSM define the Tea Party for you.\n\nRoberta X said...\n\nNot even Glen Beck? --I think there's been a lot of co-opting and deliberate conflation. It's not even one party, just a whole lot of smaller groups using the same acronym.\n\nNew Jovian Thunderbolt said...\n\nGlen Beck is in the Social Conservative circle of the Venn Diagram. The part he is in also intersects the Tea Party Venn circle.\n\nThat's how I see it, at least. Tam might be similar, but I can't speak for her.\n\nBubblehead Les. said...\n\nYou know, if someone came out and said that the Democratic Party can \"Go to Hell\" a la Maxine Waters, or that the Democrats would like to see a bunch of Right Wing Tea Partyer's \"Hung from a Tree\", a la Andre Carson, Holder's Civil Rights Division would be on them for Hate Speech so fast, with \"Flash Mobs\" hitting the Streets....\n\nJake (formerly Riposte3) said...\n\n\"It's not even one party, just a whole lot of smaller groups using the same acronym.\"\n\nThis. The biggest problem, and the reason the MSM has had such success tarring the TEA Party as a whole with the social conservative brush, is that the social conservatives have co-opted many of the smaller groups. Since the MSM has a great deal of control over the movement's visibility (on the national scale, at least), they focus on these groups to the exclusion of all others, in order to create the perception that they want the public to have.\n\nThus, the public perception of the TEA Party as 1) a unified political organization like the R's or D's, and b) a concentration of the religious/social conservative extremists that think the R's aren't far enough to the \"right\".\n\nwv: yogge - The offspring of a particular bear from Jellystone National Park and a shoggoth. It has a habit of driving people mad with its mere presence so that it can steal their picnic basket.\n\ndocjim505 said...\n\nWhat BC said.\n\nWith regard to the Tea Party(ies) and \"social conservatives\", I suggest that is right: the Tea Parties started out pretty much single-issue: fiscal conservatism. That there are many social conservatives in the Tea Parties don't make them social-con in character, however. One doesn't see Tea Party rallies about abortion or gay marriage, but rather about taxes, wasteful government spending, and regulation.\n\ndocjim505 said...\n\nDoh! Should have read:\n\n\"I suggest that Tam is right.\"\n\nSorry. As I get older, I'm really starting to get that whole \"proof read\" thing Mrs. Blair used to yap about in 8th grade English.\n\nJoanna said...\n\nMr. Carson is, in a word, tiresome.\n\nNathan said...\n\nI think my attitude is pretty much a synthesis between BC and Joanna.\n\nThe bottom line, as I told someone earlier today: The acorn didn't fall very far from Grandma.\n\nAnd the last redistricting means he'll no longer \"represent\" me after the next election. Which is fine by me."}

Could jump straight there from Williamsport?\n\nIn the Reading/Lehigh game, won by Lehigh 3-0\u2026\n\n  \u2022 Dan Meyer threw four shutout for the IronPigs.\n  \u2022 Mike Zagurski had a scoreless inning, as did Phillippe Aumont, who struck out the side.\n  \u2022 Scott Mathieston pitched two scoreless innings.\n  \u2022 Austin Hyatt pitched well, allowing two runs over five innings.\n  \u2022 Freddy Galvis had two hits in an otherwise quiet afternoon.\n\nTuesday below the fold.\n\n\nBuilding the Farm System\n\nWednesday, March 30th, 2011\n\nPaul Hagen has a tremendous story in today\u2019s Philadelphia Daily News on the Phillies farm system and specifically the commitment they have made in making it one of the top systems in the league.\n\nRead the full article here. Here is a snippet:\n\n\u201c[Player development and scouting] is still where it\u2019s all done. If you don\u2019t draft well and you don\u2019t develop well, you\u2019re going to hit a period of time where the cycle\u2019s going to go the other way,\u201d [David] Montgomery said. \u201cBecause to keep your own can become expensive. To acquire from the outside can be more so, both in terms of talent and in dollars. And you\u2019ll never do it in trades unless you\u2019re developing over there.\u201d\n\n\nWith most of their most highly rated prospects \u2013 first baseman/outfielder Jonathan Singleton and righthanders Jarred Cosart and Brody Colvin \u2013 still in the low minors, the Phillies could find themselves in a pickle if the younger plays come slowly, or never make it at all, or if the nucleus ages prematurely.\n\nAfter all, Utley\u2019s absence might not seem quite so dire if Cardenas or Donald were still around to step in until he comes back.\n\nMontgomery readily admitted these are concerns and stressed again the need to juggle the imperative to win right now with keeping one eye on the future.\n\n\u201cThe public will focus on the moves [general manager Ruben Amaro Jr.] makes. The reality is whatever Ruben is able to do is primarily dictated by how quickly those people come. You can\u2019t talk trades to clubs in situations where they may have a player of Roy Oswalt\u2019s quality available unless you have Anthony Gose. Kyle Drabek and all the others. That is a lot of minor league talent we traded,\u201d he pointed out.\n\nRemember, the Phillies traded away prospects to get Cliff Lee, Roy Halladay, and Roy Oswalt over the last 20 months. That they still have a top 10 system is a testament to the outstanding scouting and player development work they have done.\nI was having this discussion with someone the other day. If I\u2019m running a small-market team (or a large-market team for that matter), what\u2019s $2.5 million (aka the back-up catcher or long-man) off an $80 million payroll on a lousy team? Why not invest that money into the draft? Are you going to be right all the time? No. But you don\u2019t have to be right every time to significantly improve your farm system.\n\nCatches of the Day\n\nWednesday, March 30th, 2011\n\n2011-cod-issue-1-coverEvery year, the BlueClaws have a different theme for the Catch of the Day game program.

Here\u2019s the roundup from yesterday\u2019s action in Clearwater.\n\nLakewood (Win 4-3)\n\n  \u2022 David Buchanan gave up one run over 4.1 innings with four strikeouts in his longest outing of the spring. The 7th round pick from Georgia State has had a good spring and is probably in the Lakewood rotation as the year starts next week.\n  \u2022 Mike Zagurski, just sent down, threw 1.2 shutout innings in this game, probably so he didn\u2019t have to get on the bus with the AAA team (same for Scott Mathieson in the next game).\n  \u2022 Two hits for 2B Matthew Payton and LF Zach Collier. C Fransico Diaz had a double and 1B Drew Rundle a triple.\n  \u2022 OF watch: LF: Collier, CF: Aaron Altherr, RF: Anthony Hewitt, DH: Geancarlo Mendez.\n\nClearwater (Loss 3-0)\n\n  \u2022 Clearwater had just three hits in the game, one each by Alan Schoenberger, Jonathan Singleton, and Stephen Batts.\n  \u2022 Scott Mathieson threw two shutout innings, while Bryan Morgado and Julian Sampson each threw one.\n  \u2022 Brody Colvin, however, struggled to find the zone, walking six over four innings and allowing the three runs. He\u2019ll still have at least one more start before the real games starts.\n\nReading (Loss 5-1)\n\n  \u2022 Two hits each for Joe Savery and Derrick Mitchell and Savery smacked a HR for the Reading run.\n  \u2022 Miguel Alvarez, with WPT last year, played with the R-Phils here.\n  \u2022 Ryan Edell gave up four runs in 4.2 innings.\n  \u2022 Three 2010 BlueClaws pitched here: Joe Esposito, Ebelin Lugo, Eric Massingham.\n\nLehigh Valley (Loss 8-1)\n\n  \u2022 Five hits: Korby Mintken, Carlos Perdomo, Mike Spidale, Jeff Larish, Matthew Miller.\n  \u2022 Edgar Garcia & Garrett Claypool each gave up two runs in one inning while starter Brian Bass gave up four in 3.2.\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth (probably nothing), the records of these clubs this spring: LHV 7-5, REA 6-4-2, CLR 4-6-2, LAK 6-6.\n\nFriday Spring Roundup\n\nSaturday, March 26th, 2011\n\nzachcollierspringschofieldWe\u2019re about a week away from camp breaking down in Florida. The northern teams (Lakewood, Reading, and Lehigh Valley) will fly up on Sunday, April 3rd with exhibition games on the 5th and the opener on the 7th. Let\u2019s take a look around minor league spring training from action on Friday in Florida.\n\nLakewood (Loss 7-3)\n\n  \u2022 A very quiet game for Lakewood, picking up just four hits (one each from Zach Collier, Patrick Murray, Geancarlo Mendez, and Kelly Dugan).\n  \u2022 Colby Shreve started here and gave up five runs in three innings. Hector Neris gave up one hit in two scoreless innings and Matt Hutchison had a shutout inning as did Juary Gomez.\n  \u2022 OF watch: Kelly Dugan and Zach Collier in LF, Kyrell Hudson in CF, Domingo Santana in RF, and Aaron Altherr was the DH.\n\nClearwater (Loss 5-1)\n\n  \u2022 Herlis Rodriguez, who I am unfamiliar with, gave up two runs, one earned, in three innings for Dusty Wathan\u2019s club.\n  \u2022 Chase Johnson, an \u201909 draft pick from South Mountain CC, threw two scoreless innings of relief.\n  \u2022 Clearwater had just five hits: one each from Leandro Castro, Stephen Batts, Drew Rundle, Robert Stumpo, and Edgar Duran.\n\nReading (Tie 7-7)\n\n  \u2022 Mark Parent\u2019s club is 6-3-2 this spring after their tie on Friday. Mike Cisco started and gave up just one run over four innings.\n  \u2022 Jordan Whatcott, a possible BlueClaw (undrafted FA last year from Utah) tossed two perfect innings of relief.\n  \u2022 Two hits and a double for both Cody Overbeck and Fidel Hernandez (2 RBIs). Torre Langley had a triple in his only at bat.\n\nLehigh Valley (Win 7-4)\n\n  \u2022 The only club to win on Friday, the IronPigs got 4.2 strong innings (two runs) from Eddie Bonine.\n  \u2022 Phillippe Aumont threw two shutout innings of relief while Justin De Fratus threw a shutout 9th.\n  \u2022 Rich Thompson, Mike Spidale, Jeff Larish, Carlos Rivero, Harold Garcia, Troy Hanzawa, and Carlos Ruiz all had a hit. Nobody had two.\n\nBullpens: Philly and Lehigh Valley\n\nSaturday, March 26th, 2011\n\nThe Phillies finalized their bullpen today, optioning Mike Zagurski and Scott Mathieson to Lehigh Valley.\n\nWhat could their bullpen be? Probably something to the effect of: Ryan Madson, Jose Contreras, JC Romero, Antonio Bastardo, Kyle Kendrick, David Herndon, Danys Baez. That\u2019s with Brad Lidge on the disabled list to start the season.\n\nBastardo (07) and Kendrick (04-06) are former BlueClaws.\n\nThat means, as Phuture Phillies notes:\n\nOn the bright side for Lehigh Valley fans, the bullpen appears to stack up very well with Mathieson, Zagurski, Schwimer, and Stutes pitching the later innings for the \u2018Pigs.\n\nScott Mathieson (04), Mike Zagurski (06), Mike Stutes (08) are all former BlueClaws. And Justin De Fratus (09) will either open there or be there soon.\n\nLehigh, who has never had a winning record, ever (2008-2010), will give it a run with a quality bullpen like that.\n\nToday in the Asbury Park Press\n\nSaturday, March 26th, 2011\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead the whole thing. Click here.\n\nLook What We Found\n\nFriday, March 25th, 2011\n\nWas digging through the computer earlier today looking for something (which I did not find). However, I did find this awesome jingle. Sing along by clicking here.\n\nThis jingle I believe is 10 years old and was created during the team\u2019s inaugural season of 2001.\n\nToday in the APP\n\nFriday, March 25th, 2011\n\nTony Graham has a story in today\u2019s Asbury Park Press on 2010 BlueClaws 1B Jonathan Singleton, who is spending the spring learning to play left field, a position he will play this year for Clearwater. A snippet:\n\n\u201cThe line drives right over your head are definitely difficult,\u201d Singleton said. \u201cBut with the more experience you have seeing them, the easier they become.\u201d\n\n\u201cObviously his game is his bat,\u201d LaMar said. \u201cHe\u2019s got good power and it\u2019s just a matter of if he keeps hitting we\u2019re going to keep moving him up. He\u2019s got a chance to be a fine young hitter.\u201d\n\nBe sure to read the entire article here.\n\nThe Best Game Notes Line Ever\n\nThursday, March 24th, 2011\n\nYesterday, driving Ruben Amaro, Jr. and Phillies President David Montgomery to Port Charlotte to watch the Phillies play the Rays, Asst GM Scott Proefrock\u2019s car ran out of gas. You can read about that here. Now, the Phillies had the following line in their game notes today, easily the best game note of all time:\n\n\u201cProefrock had enough gas to make the return trip to Clearwater, however, it should be noted that he asked his passengers for toll money as he does not have a Sun Pass.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s just funny. I think my favorite BlueClaws note over the last two years has been this.\n\nSweet 16\n\nThursday, March 24th, 2011\n\nWhat former BlueClaws went to schools playing in the Sweet 16 (aka who should you root for)?\n\nSan Diego State: Quintin Berry (07), Troy Hanzawa (09)\n\nArizona: Jason Donald (07), John Hardy (06), Anthony Gose (09-committed but signed w/ Phillies)\n\nWisconsin: Chad Sidowsky (2001, an original BlueClaw)\n\nNorth Carolina: Jason Knapp (09-committed but signed w/ Phillies)\n\nKansas: Mike Zagurski (06), Gus Milner (07)\n\nFlorida: Aaron Cheesman (06), Robby Read (03)\n\nI\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s it. If not, leave in the comments and we\u2019ll update."}

The story finds the citizens of Ogden Marsh infected with a man-made virus unleashed by the military, and only Sheriff Dutton (the amazing Timothy Olyphant) and his pregnant wife (Radha Mitchell) can stop the madness from breaking past county walls. It's an intense two hour ride that will leave you sweating through the couch in this summer heat. We caught up with director Breck Eisner to chat with him (for the umpteenth time) about his awesome little horror flick that continues to surprise horror aficionados and critics alike. Here's our conversation:\n\nWhy, in your opinion, do you think The Crazies is the perfect film to watch at home this summer?\n\nBreck Eisner: (Laughs) Yeah, you're setting me up, huh?\n\nI'm not setting you up. I think The Crazies is a great movie.\n\nBreck Eisner: Thank you. I think, if you can get a bunch of friends together, and you can pop in the Blu-ray, or the DVD if you have it, it's an awesome movie to watch with a group of people. And what better time to get a group of people together than the summer? This is a cool, fun, scary horror movie.\n\nDo you ever consider the home viewing experience when you set out to direct a film? Or are your thoughts strictly centered on how it will play in a theater to a large audience?\n\nBreck Eisner: I love watching the movie with an audience. I love that an audience sits together and watches a movie in a darkened theater. They aren't pausing it. They don't typically get up. They have that group experience. I like to make a movie with the hope that they'll watch it in the theater. I do know and realize that most people will see a movie, barring if its Avatar, at home or on the computer. But I'm a purist. I design it for the theater. I know people have giant screens now. They have their Blu-ray players. It's all on another level. They can download it on Hi-Def. They have great sound systems. There's not much delineation between your home system and the theater system. Not like it used to be. But for horror? Typically watching it at home is a solitary experience. Maybe there are two people watching it. What you miss not seeing it at a theater is that group experience. I think watching a horror movie or a comedy with a group is a really great way to watch a movie.\n\nThe Crazies is ten times better than 98% of the summer movies we've seen so far this year, nearly all of which have been sequels, reboots, remakes, or adaptations. What is your insight into making a \"reimagining\", as you've called The Crazies, that truly works for today's audiences?\n\nBreck Eisner: Sure. I can give you a lot of insight into it. Choose wisely. Make sure the movie you are attempting to remake has a reason to be remade. Either the social relevance of the movie made at that time still has some social relevance today. Or you can reengineer the movie so that it has a new social relevance for today's audience. But first, you just have to make a good movie. There has to be a good script. It's got to have good characters. There needs to be interesting character journeys. There has to be good character relationships. Ultimately, it shouldn't matter that it's a remake. You can't rest on the laurels of thinking the audience will come just because they know the brand. It has got to be a good movie. People, nowadays, can smell a stinker from a mile away. From the very first screening, everyone knows. The secret is, \"Believe in the movie itself.\" Don't just hope that people are going to go see it because they know the names of the characters and the title.\n\nNow, people hear the word reboot or reimagining, and they immediately think it's a stinker. Even this movie wasn't greeted with a warm welcome initially. It really worked on word of mouth. The audience hears that it's a Romero remake, and they automatically don't want to see it. They think it's going to be bad by default.\n\nBreck Eisner: (Laughs) Yes. We definitely had to overcome that. You take the title, The Crazies, first of all. It's kind of a bizarre title. I kind of love it. It's memorable. But it doesn't lend itself to being elevated horror. That was something we were going for. You can easily mop this into the remake category. And you can bump it into the zombie category. I had to realize that, \"Yes, this is a \"remake\" movie. That it is a George A. Romero film, so people are going to think its about zombies.\" But they are different. They were designed different, because The Crazies were never intended to be zombies.\n\nYou've said in the past that you would have never attempted to redo a George A. Romero film if it were one of his more well-made, more cherish projects. And that Zack Snyder had a lot of balls to tackle Dawn of the Dead. But now, you are going after Escape From New York, which is one of both John Carpenter and Kurt Russell's seminal works. Do you hold George A. Romero in higher esteem than John Carpenter? Do you think Carpenter is a lesser director? Or do you truly believe that this material is in need of a face-lift?\n\nBreck Eisner: I don't consider John Carpenter or George A. Romero to be better than one or the other. They are both different types of filmmakers. And I am a big fan of both of theirs. Its not my favorite, but one of my all-time favorite horror movies is The Thing. I hold them both in high esteem. They both made movies that are great, and some that are not so great. I wouldn't say that I am a big fan of John Carpenter's Escape from L.A.. Kurt Russell surfing? That just gets me every time. But certainly, there is a risk involved with remaking Escape from New York. I read the script, and it is really good. We are doing a polish on it. But I really like the script. I went back and rewatched it. I'd seen it as a kid countless times. When I was a kid, I loved that movie. The reality of Escape from New York today is that the social meaning of it is not true any more. The movie is a comment on urban decay. The suburban flight. All of that was coming out of the late 70s and early 80s. When the movie came out. That doesn't exist today. The thought for me is, \"Is there any relevance today to make Escape from New York?\" When we were developing it, when I was looking at it, and I was analyzing it, I realized that the world is a completely different place. New York has a completely different character now than it did back then. The idea of turning it into a prison is a completely different level of social commentary. I liked the idea of discovering this movie through a completely different set of eyes in a different decade. That gave me the confidence that there is a reason to make this movie. That, and there was a similar thing that I found with The Crazies. George A. Romero had made this incredibly low budget movie. Escape from New York wasn't a low budget movie for it's time, but John Carpenter was working from this much bigger canvas. A lot of things, like the president's plane crashing into the building? It was quite telling that they had a simulation on an Atari video screen. There are a lot of places in that movie where its obvious that Carpenter wanted to do bigger and better, and cooler things. He couldn't, because he couldn't afford that. We can do that now. The other thing, I think, that is missing from the original Escape from New York is the identity and the recognizability of New York. The New York sets were all shot in St. Louis after a big fire rendered a bunch of warehouses uninhabitable. Aside from a few establishing, lower-end matte shots, that New York is not often there. It's just these random, obscure warehouses. My idea, which I am really excited about, is making sure every location is clearly identifiable as the real New York City. A repurposed New York City.\n\nSouthland Tales touches on some of these themes. Have you looked at that movie as far as what Richard Kelly did right, and what he did wrong?\n\nBreck Eisner: No, I haven't actually watched that film since I started working on Escape from New York. That's a good idea. I will.\n\nThere's some great ideas in that movie. There are also some not so great ideas. It's a very strange tale.\n\nBreck Eisner: That often happens when your ambition is bigger than your budget.\n\nThe idea of a sequel to the Crazies has been tossed around quite a bit, but you've never said that its something you'd truly enjoy doing. And you have quite a bit on your plate. Do you think that if a sequel does happen, it will be made by someone else? And do you have a seed of an idea about what the story will be, and who you would like to see do it?\n\nBreck Eisner: I would love to pass this off to someone else. To see their interpretation of the movie. The way George A. Romero did with me, I would love to hand it off to the next guy. And see what he or she does. That would be kind of exciting. There have been no internal discussions about franchising this movie. The design of the film? The open ending of it has nothing to do with setting up a franchise. It's what felt right to me in ending this particular movie. I didn't want to tie it up in a big bow, I didn't want everyone to be okay. This movie is a cautionary tale. The ending is ambiguous. That is on purpose. The fact that I love 70s horror had a lot to do with it. 70s horror hardly ever ended happy. Those films ended kind of bleak. I couldn't help but be influenced by that.\n\nThe fans know about the alternate ending to this film. Why was it not included on the DVD or Blu-ray? Are you of the mindset that it wraps the viewers' perception of a story and what it means? Or did it have anything to do with the way a sequel might be set up in the future?\n\nBreck Eisner: There were multiple reasons why we didn't include it. I went back and forth a lot on it. By the way, the alternate ending is the only scene we cut out of the movie. There was a half-a-page dinner scene that was nothing. It was a nothing scene that we cut out. Other than that, there was nothing that we cut out. There was nothing left on the floor. Obviously there were bits of scenes cut out, but nothing whole. That's the way we were able to make this on such a small budget. In terms of the ending, we shot two endings. This is the less bleak of the two endings. The other ending is quite bleak. David (Timothy Olyphant) gets infected. He brings the virus out of Ogden Marsh, and the infection spreads. It didn't work as well, because the audience was really invested in the characters. Its one thing to have a downer ending in concept. But its another thing to see it happening in real time to your heroes, who you've lived with through this horrifying experience the whole time. We worked hard on this ending, and on deciding what the real ending should be. I felt that I didn't want to throw another option up there. I didn't want to say, \"Oh, well, the movie could have ended this way.\" We shot two endings knowing one would live and one would die. They both fit the same story. They both bring the infection out and it continues. It was just told from two different points of view. And I didn't love the execution of the scene. It wasn't my favorite scene. Its didn't feel like it worked. And it didn't work in the movie. It didn't work in and of itself. I thought, \"Why put this on there?\"\n\nHow did you guys go about creating the motion comics? And did you want to utilize those in showing some of the scenes that you weren't able to film due to the time restrictions and the budget you were working with?\n\nBreck Eisner: What was cool about the motion comics, and they were made for real, hard comics, was that they allowed us to have another point of view that we couldn't afford to show in the movie. Afford in terms of screen time more than anything else. Each of the authors and artists were given one set of characters to follow. They had read the script. They were given full latitude to do whatever they wanted. We, in no way, influenced their ideas, other than by showing them the source material. Sort of the way George A. Romero gave us the freedom to remake his movie. It was exciting to me to see what these four different teams came up with. And how they characterized the plague of Trixie, and how they characterized the infected people. It was a cool experiment. It was done as a tool to promote the movie. Because we didn't have the budget for a print campaign. There were no billboards. There was a very small scope for publicity and advertising. Outside of TV. It was a way to help get the word out. It was also a clever and fun way. I think the motion comics are really well made.\n\nLast question. I know you are making Escape From New York next, as well as Blood of the Innocent. So who is Timothy Olyphant going to play? Jack the Ripper? Dracula? Or Snake Plissken?\n\nBreck Eisner: (Laughs) All three if you ask me. I love working with Timothy Olyphant, and I will be working with him again. He is an amazing actor. A talented guy. And he's incredibly funny. He needs to do a great comedy, because he is a funny guy. But I will work with him again. I can promise you that.\n\nCan you talk at all about this idea that he might very well be our next Snake Plissken?\n\n\nWell, I hope you do hire him. He's one of the reasons why I enjoyed The Crazies so much.\n\nBreck Eisner: Well, thank you. He is a great actor and a pleasure to be around.\n\nThe Crazies makes its DVD and Blu-ray debut this Tuesday, June 29th.\n\n\nShare this story yet?\n\n0 0 0 0 0"}

{"dataman_score": 3.0, "text": "Letter: NOW's challenge is misplaced\n\nMrs. Pat Greenfield\nSt. Augustine\nPublished Friday, March 16, 2001\n\nInteresting to note that NOW (National Organization of Women -- which by the way as a woman does not represent me!) has chosen to challenge in court a license plate which they say represents the state's accepting religious tenets and therefore ''putting their seal of approval'' on that message. They base this upon the fact that in the book of Deuteronomy (30:19), Moses states: ''I call heaven and earth today to witness against you: I have set before you life and death, the blessing and the curse. Choose life, then, that you and your descendants may live.'' Moses is speaking to his people about obeying the commandments and, if they do not, they will perish. When he states they should choose life he means they should judiciously obey the Ten Commandments or perish. There are many, many phrases in the Bible which deal explicitly with the sanctity of life, but because two of the words from Deuteronomy 30:19 are the same as those on the license plates, it seems this is the only premise NOW could come up with for a challenge in law of the 23rd most popular license plate in the state, established to promote adoption over abortion which reads: ''Choose Life.''\n\nIf it is to be a criminal offense to use or depict biblical words as a catch phrase for a cause, whatever that cause may be, then I contend that we in the pro-life movement have a perfect lawsuit in that the pro-aborts have chosen four of the most sacred words in scripture as their motto. The most frequently used phrase that is stated by those who favor abortion are those of Jesus at the Last Supper: \"This is my body!\" Christians of all descriptions and denominations should be the ones bringing lawsuits to stop this scandalous use of some of the most sacred words of the Bible.\n\nRelated Searches"}

The odds of making this prediction correctly is 1 in 864,000. Maybe not the most impossible odds but hard enough to be practically impossible in a single guess two years before the fact. And then of course we could ask what is the exact headline of the New York Times on September 30th 2011? Again, not technically impossible but practically so. Especially if combined with the sports prediction.\n\nYou do this, and nothing really more needs to be asked in my opinion. For if time travel is proved, then that answers so many many questions in itself, while making nearly everything else discussed in this forum or any forum almost irrelevant.

It will be a summer of extreme weather on both ends of the scale. This planet is out of ballance, weather wise and the way we manage our resources, thus we can expect things to be harsh.\n\nBug infestations like flies, mosquitoes, bed bugs, wood tics, etc. will also be extreme this season.\n\nWe will feel the bite of a planet in distress.\n\nWill the promise be kept?

I prefer to call it a rescue mission.\n\nI think that will be on the cusp of another one of Earth's, darkest hour. We have abused this planet into a major rejuvination .... which means this planet will shed the things causing it to be out of ballance. The natural balance has been disrupted.\n\nWe have nature to watch, to get the drift of what will take place. What happens when one species takes too large of a bite out of this ballance, nature needs to continue in harmony? Nature has a way of restoring this ballance, all on it's own.\n\nI have to admit, the prospect is bleak for most of the human race.\n\nThere have been many predictions, herein, that have matured to prove them selves valid. However there are many that we are waiting to see, yet. I have not been given any reason to doubt they will come to pass.\n\nI am glad to see how resilliant the system is, and that we can expect to see the majority of Earths humans being around for the grand entrance of our root race and unveiling of our history going back to creation...of this planet and it's population by us, the plant and the animal species we see here today.\n\nMake no mistake, we didn't just happen to be here. There is purpose to our lives on this rock. We will be brought up to speed with the details.\n\nposted on Jul, 6 2009 @ 05:18 PM\nHey Dudes !!!!!!!!!!!\n\nI know TD has highlighted many personal confirmations over the last few years of things that line up with what he has experienced.\n\nI was just wanting to make a quick post of a confirmation for something I have been saying. I am too lazy to find where I wrote it exactly in this thread but I have mentioned about how we would soon see the UFO's dance in the skies and chase each other around like butterflies.

{"dataman_score": 4.0, "text": "WJHC Who to Watch: Czech Republic, Switzerland and Latvia\n\nUpdated: December 23, 2012\nmartin Frk\n\nThe Day is nearly here, the Pre-Tournament Games are done, and its time for the World Juniors. In October I did early looks and predictions on what the rosters might look like, but I think its time to update them now, as teams are being set, and the tournament is ready to go. If you want to see any of my previous articles you can find a complete listing of my them here.\n\nOver the Next two days I will give you are preview of Each Team in the Tournament, highlighting the key players to watch, their strengths and weaknesses, and what to look forward to in the Tournament. Today, we\u2019ll look at Pool A, which features defending champ Sweden, the impressive Finns, the always dangerous Czech Republic, a team that is no stranger to upsets in Switzerland, and an underrated team from Latvia.\n\nTomorrow we\u2019ll look at Pool B, featuring, Canada, the United States, Russia, Germany, and Slovakia.\n\nSo lets move on to the Czechs, Latvians, and Swiss, three underdogs in Group A.\n\nFrom UFA with gloves\n\n\nTeam Latvia\n\nNot a medal contender, Latvia will be quite content if they can avoid relegation in this tournament. That said, they are getting strong all the time and will feature some intriguing names to watch in the tournament.\n\nTeodors \u201cTeddy\u201d Blugers, Centre/Left Wing: The second round pick of the Pittsburgh Penguins in June\u2019s NHL Entry draft, Blugers is a freshman for the Minnesota State \u2013 Mankato Mavericks: He\u2019s started out very well at the NCAA level with 12 points in his first 18 games. Blugers played in the World Juniors last year, and scored 1 goal and 3 points in 6 games in the tournament. Blugers should be better this year as he will have one year more development to draw from. He put up incredible stats at Shattuck St. Mary\u2019s famous hockey prep school last year, but the level of competition he faced should be questioned when looking at the 88 points in 51 games he scored. This season we can see a good skater who seems to be more of a playmaker, with his really good passing and vision. He also has a decent shot. Expect him to get huge minutes in this tournament.\u00a0 With Buffalo refusing to release Zemgus Girgensons to play in the tourney, he\u2019ll be Latvia\u2019s main offensive weapon.\n\n\nTeam Switzerland:\n\nSwitzerland lacks the big names that Latvia has, but I give this team a better chance to upset one of the Czechs, Finns, or Swedes and find themselves in the top 3 of the pool and in a playoff spot. Don\u2019t get me wrong, they are still a long shot to get out of the pool stage, but the Swiss always come to the World Juniors with strong team play and a well defined defensive system. This system frustrates opponents, keeps games close, and allows the team to compete. If you give the Swiss a lead late in a game, its tough to come back.\n\ncredit: OHL Images\n\nTanner Richard, Centre/Left Wing: Richard played on the 2012 team and had an excellent tournament scoring 4 points in 6 games. The third round pick of the Tampa Bay Lightning is playing for the Guelph Storm this season where he has posted 3 goals and 36 assists in 29 games so far. Clearly with numbers like those its not hard to see that Richard is more of a playmaker than a finisher. He shows good vision and passing skills at the OHL level. Richard could use some work on his acceleration and top end speed, but he\u2019s well balanced on his skates, and tough to knock off the puck. He also is a good stickhandler and is able to extend plays to allow his teammates to get open.\n\nRichard is solid defensively and like Girgensons, i expect him to be not just the best offensive player on his team, but also to be asked to shut down the oppositions top lines.\n\nTeam Czech Republic:\nThe Czechs are the best of these three teams on paper, and have a lot of known players and NHL draft picks this year. The team should advance past the pool stage and finish in the top 3. Questions about depth and goaltending remain though and this keeps them from joining the other true medal contenders\n\nDavid Musil, Defence: Recent traded from the Vancouver Giants to the Edmonton Oil Kings, David Musil is also the son of former NHL defenceman Frantisek Musil. He was picked by the Edmonton Oilers with the the the first pick of the 2nd round in the 2011 draft, Musil is playing 25+ minutes per game in the WHL this season and has shown 15 points in 27 games.\n\nThe offensive numbers are impressive, but Musil is a big, rugged, defence first defenceman. He is strong on the boards and overpowers opponents to win battles and come away with the puck. He also works effectively down low and keeps the front of the net clear so his goalie can see the puck. His positioning and footwork are at an advanced level for his age, and this should come as no surprise as he\u2019s probably had 19 years of teaching from his father. Musil knows how to wait for the opportunity and pick his spots so he doesn\u2019t get caught out of position often, but he does like to throw a big hit if its available. Expect him to continue to need to rely on his strong endurance and to be used 25-30 minutes per game by the Czech coaches.\n\nFaksa_goal_shoutRadek Faksa, Centre: Faksa has had a bit of a slow start in Kitchener this year, but has picked it up in late and now has 25 points in 29 games. Last season Faksa led all OHL rookies with 66 points in 62 games and this led to his being drafted by the Dallas Stars in the first round of the NHL draft.\n\nFaksa pairs outstanding hockey sense and offensive instincts, with his very good vision and passing skills to be an excellent playmaker. He also has a good wrist shot with an excellent release. Faksa is an above average skater, with good speed and strong balance which makes him difficult to knock off the puck. He isn\u2019t afraid to go into traffic and to take hits to make plays for the Rangers. For these reasons we believe Faksa will be a top 6 centre at the NHL level. At 6\u20193, 202lbs Faksa has the great size down the middle and uses that size effectively to protect the puck, to establish position in the offensive zone. He\u2019s also an excellent defender who will be used in all situations for the Czechs.\n\nTomas Hertl, Centre: The first thing that jumps out at you when you watch Tomas Hertl, is his very unorthodox skating style. The best way to describe it is \u201cherky-jerky\u201d. However despite the fact that its not pretty, it is still reasonably effective. While Hertl is by no means a fast skater, he\u2019s not a slow one either. This unorthodox stride gets him where he\u2019s going, and his good hockey sense and instincts keep him heavily involved in the play. The San Jose Sharks first pick in the latest NHL draft, Hertl is a big, strong, versatile forward. He is capable of playing both centre and wing. He has good passing skills and vision, and is more a playmaker than a scorer. He is at his best playing a puck control game, working the boards and cycling in the offensive zone. He can effectively protect the puck, and then pass to an open teammate. Without the puck he is able to find open spaces and has good hockey sense and instincts. He\u2019s not a huge hitter, but he uses his size and strength to win board battles. Hertl could use work on his shot and his release, which are below average and so should be a playmaker on this team. Hertl is also an excellent two way player. He can be very effective on faceoffs and is a key penalty killer on the squad, showing good positioning and instincts in the defensive zone. He is a conscientious backchecker who uses his size, strength and active stick to keep defenders to the outside. .\n\nMartin Frk, Right Wing: Frk skipped this tournament last season, in a surprise move. However the Czechs are happy that they can get the Detroit Red Wings draftee back in their lineup this year. He\u2019s started the season strong with 38 points in 28 games for the Halifax Mooseheads, helping the team to reach first place in the QMJHL. When Frk is on his game, he\u2019s impossible to miss on the ice. He is one of the best agitators or pests in the QMJHL and marries that chippy play with a high skilled power forward\u2019s game He has good size and strength and uses those to throw hits, win board battles, and get to the dirty areas of the ice. He also possesses impressive offensive skills. He has a hard and accurate shot and an excellent release. Frk is also a skilled stickhandler and adept at dangling past opponents or protecting the puck from them on the cycle game. He goes hard to the net and knows what to do when he gets there. Frk also has a knack for finding open spaces on the ice and unleashing his excellent one-timer. He needs work on his defensive game and will need to be paired with the good defenders on this squad, as he is wildly inconsistent in his own end of the rink.\n\n\n\n  1.

{"dataman_score": 4.0, "text": "web analytics\nAugust 23, 2014 / 27 Av, 5774\nIsrael at War: Operation Protective Edge\nAt a Glance\nSponsored Post\n\nCongratulations to all the winners of the JewishPress.com raffle at The Event\n\nAn Unseemly Hour\n\n\nIt\u2019s my first moment of wakefulness, and I\u2019m chilled to the bone. Pull the covers over myself, I\u2019m thinking, while I decide to roll over to look at the clock. It\u2019s 5:30 a.m. and I\u2019m exhausted. But I have a blissful joy because I can pull the covers over myself. Yes, I can go back to sleep.\n\nThe reset alarm goes off at 7 a.m. and I awake yet again, this time with more energy. I feel a bit warmer and get out of bed. A half-hour later, showered and dressed, I put on my tallis and tefillin, daven Shacharis and drive to work.\n\nAfter work, I attend shul for Mincha and Ma\u2019ariv. The late afternoon starting time of 4:30 (it\u2019s winter) is much more reasonable than Shacharis at 6:15 a.m. At Ma\u2019ariv\u2019s end, the rabbi announces that his wife wants to go on a skiing vacation. He expresses his desire not to go, and instead learn and teach \u2013 all the while helping make the weak morning minyan stronger with his presence. But it\u2019s important that he listen to his wife, so they\u2019re leaving on Sunday.\n\nI have a foreboding that the rabbi is about to ask all of us to make every effort to gather a minyan while he\u2019s away, given the difficulty to do so even when he\u2019s present.\n\nWhen I think of difficulties, waking up at 5:30 a.m. comes to mind. I practically freeze up when thinking of the prospect of leaving the car at home (there\u2019s no parking near the shul) and walking eight blocks through a biting wind. Please don\u2019t ask this of us, rabbi, as every nerve in my body tells me to go back to sleep.\n\n\u201cI am asking all of you to attend one extra Shacharis minyan next week,\u201d the rabbi implored us. \u201cIf you usually come four times, please come five times. If you come once, come twice. If you usually don\u2019t come at all, come to one.\u201d\n\nLeave it to my rabbi to make such a reasonable request. Had he asked us to come every morning, I would have passed it off as pie in the sky and ecstatically slept the extra hour and a half. But since the rabbi has been good to me, I answered in the affirmative when he asked for a show of hands as to who would adhere to his appeal. Attending morning minyan \u2013 even once \u2013 is the least I could do. The day to fulfill my commitment would be the next day.\n\nDue to considerably less sleep that I\u2019m about to get (rest I could use, as the grind of working in a nursing home takes its physical toll), I am in a bad mood for a while. My disposition improves somewhat when I keep telling myself that it\u2019s only one morning. I\u2019m asleep by about 11 p.m.\n\nHere we go again. I awake at the unseemly hour of 5:30 a.m., and I\u2019m chilled to the bone. I\u2019m exhausted, so I go back to sleep. But a minute later \u2013 yes, literally a minute later \u2013 the alarm sounds. I squint and wonder if someone is playing a trick on me.\n\nOh, how I wish that I had amnesia concerning my pledge to the rabbi. But against the will of every bone in my body, I resist the temptation of more sleep \u2013 and the warmth and comfort that come with it \u2013 and within 25 minutes I\u2019m out the door, tallis and tefillin in hand.\n\nI remember that there is no legal parking near the shul at this time of day, so my trek begins on what I\u2019m convinced is the coldest day of the year.\n\nQuite unfairly, I imagine my rabbi and his wife at a chalet sitting in front of a crackling fireplace. Such thoughts do nothing to ease the pain of the biting wind in my face, which seems to be biting into everything except my resolve to follow through on what the rabbi asked of me.\n\nAfter what seemed like an eternity of walking (actually 20 minutes), I approached the shul. Walking in, I felt great warmth \u2013 both from the wintry weather outdoors and when cheery congregants said good morning and expressed their happiness at seeing me. I don\u2019t think I was ever happier to walk into a synagogue.\n\nI was also glad to be fulfilling my obligation to help make the minyan. And when the last \u201camen\u201d was said at the davening\u2019s conclusion, I could have danced a jig to celebrate my sense of accomplishment.\n\nAs I headed out the shul door, I heard wishes between others to have a good day and how they looked forward to seeing each other the next morning. But this didn\u2019t apply to me, so when I faced the cold biting air I was warmed by the thought of where I would be and what I would be doing in 24 hours.\n\nTo be sure, I was a little more tired that day than usual. But the satisfaction of having helped the rabbi gave me a boost, and, as much as I didn\u2019t want to admit it, so did davening with nine other Jews.\n\nAs I set my alarm that night for 7 a.m. the next morning, I hoped that the required 10 men would gather the following morning to form a minyan. I told myself that that wasn\u2019t my problem, since I had done what I was asked to do. My last waking thought: now I can sleep!\n\nI awake at 5:30 a.m. (any message here?), and exult at the thought of rolling over and falling back asleep. But for some reason I can\u2019t.\n\nI think of my rabbi, but this time he is not sitting in a chalet with his wife in front of a crackling fireplace. No, he\u2019s putting on his tallis and tefillin at the ski lodge and he has a worried look on his face. He\u2019s thinking, \u201cWill my shul get a minyan?\u201d\n\nThen I think about how awake I am, unable to fall back to sleep. I recall how, despite seemingly impossible odds, I had pulled myself from under the covers and made it to minyan the day before. Having proven to myself that I could do it the day before, I knew I could do it again today.\n\nMy desire strong, I got out of bed. And once again, I was out the door 25 minutes later. And even though it was still colder than the prior morning, nothing was going to stop me now.\n\nI made the minyan regularly during the rest of the rabbi\u2019s absence. When he returned, he seemed genuinely moved when I told him of my achievement.\n\nSince then, I\u2019ve attended minyan week after week and year after year. For the most part I\u2019ve been making Shacharis minyan for the last 20 years \u2013 on hot and cold days, and those in-between.\n\nHad the rabbi asked me to commit to minyan attendance for the whole week, I probably would have done nothing. But he didn\u2019t ask for much, so I went the distance.\n\nAbout the Author:\n\n\n\n\nNo Responses to \u201cAn Unseemly Hour\u201d\n\nComments are closed.\n\nSocialTwist Tell-a-Friend\n\nCurrent Top Story\nHamas Sinks to Child Sacrifice in Thirst for Jewish Blood\nLatest Judaism Stories\n\n\n\n\n\nHashem recalls everything \u2013 nothing is hidden from His eyes.\n\n\n\n\n\u2018Vendors Of Fruits And Clothing\u2026May Sell In Private\u2019\n(Mo\u2019ed Katan 13b)\n\n\nVia Email\n\n\nNothing is more effective to diminish envy than gratitude.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore Articles from Alan Magill\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Latest Poll\n\n\n    View Results\n\n    Loading ...\u00a0Loading ...\n\nPrinted from: http://www.jewishpress.com/judaism/jewish-columns/lessons-in-emunah/an-unseemly-hour/2012/03/21/\n\nScan this QR code to visit this page online:"}

{"dataman_score": 4.0, "text": "1. Health\n\nCan Plus Size and Overweight People Do Pilates?\n\n\nUpdated January 03, 2012\n\nQuestion: Can Plus Size and Overweight People Do Pilates?\nFirst, let's be clear that we are talking about Pilates for overweight and plus size, not exercise for obesity which has some different exercise guidelines.\n\nIf you are overweight or just a big person, exercise can be intimidating, and an exercise class even more so. Add to that the reputation Pilates has for creating lean bodies and you might think everyone in a Pilates class will be agile, toned, and slim, and you won't fit in. Happily, that's just one of the myths about Pilates. Pilates is actually well-suited for plus size people.\n\n\nPilates Benefits for Plus Size Fitness\n\nPeople of all sizes, shapes, and ages take Pilates classes. They are there, as you would be, to take advantage of the many benefits of Pilates.\n\nAmong the significant benefits of Pilates for plus size and overweight people is that it increases the strength and coordination of the muscles of the core of the body -- those that support the spine and organs.\n\nWhen the core is strong, alignment and posture improve, relieving stress on the joints and muscles. This is one of the reasons Pilates is often recommended for back pain as well. Increased flexibility, muscle tone, and balance are nothing to scoff at either.\n\nPilates Exercises Fit Plus Size People\n\nPilates exercises are done on a mat or on various types of Pilates equipment. Either way, mat or equipment, Pilates exercises are generally done lying down, sitting, and sometimes kneeling. These positions make Pilates exercises well-suited for larger people who may not be comfortable standing for long periods, or in exercise systems that require a lot of shifts of weight.\n\nIn addition, Pilates exercises can be modified for different levels and physical needs. An experienced instructor will be able to adjust mat exercises and/or the equipment set-up to help you gradually improve strength and endurance, working your way into Pilates exercises.\n\nIf you are significantly overweight or extra tall, you might want to start with a private lesson(s). This will enable your instructor to find the best modifications and props for you. It will also help the instructor suggest classes, and let you get comfortable with the exercises and equipment.\nGetting Started in Pilates\n\nPilates Equipment for Overweight People\n\nIf you are concerned about your size with regard to Pilates equipment like the reformer, tower, or Pilates chair. Don't be. Professional Pilates equipment is very sturdy. We're talking heavy-duty wood, metal, strong springs, leather straps - where am I going with this? I just want to assure you that Pilates equipment will hold you, even if it is scary looking. This is not necessarily true of Pilates equipment made for home use. And you may find a Pilates studio that has not invested in good equipment, but that would be a rare instance.\n\nBeing Comfortable at the Studio\n\nA Pilates studio should be a place where you feel welcome. If you try one and you don't feel good there, it's worth trying again. Studios can have very different \"vibes\". If you have concerns about your size, call the studio and speak with the owner or an instructor. That way they can reassure you, or let you know if they can't work with you for some reason. If you get a receptionist and you don't feel secure with their answers, ask to have an instructor or the studio owner call you back.\nHow to Find Pilates Classes\n\nA note about Pilates workouts: You are going to be hearing a lot about pulling your abdominal muscles in or scooping your abs. If you have extra weight in your mid-section that is not going to look very dramatic. That's OK. Looks are not the point. You will be able to feel it, and an experienced instructor will recognize the effects of your work as it is reflected in your alignment and how you are moving in an exercise.\n\nPlus Size Workout Clothing\n\nPilates is not hard to dress for. T shirts and sweats are fine as long as they don't reveal too much and allow the instructor to see your body. But workout clothing can be more fun than that.\nPlus size clothing resources:\nFrom About.com's exercise site: Plus Size Resources\nFrom Plus Size Fashion at About.com: Athletic Wear\nRead more in What to Wear for Pilates\n\nPilates and Weight Loss\n\nDespite our national obsession with weight loss, not every large person wants to lose weight or even needs to lose weight. However, Pilates is very supportive of weight loss. For the best weight loss results, combine Pilates with cardio exercise and an appropriate weight loss diet.\nMore information on Pilates and weight loss: Pilates, Food, and Weight Loss\nWeight Loss with a Healthy Lifestyle\nRelated Video\nWomen's Plus Size Wardrobe Makeover\n\n\u00a92014 About.com.

Weiss \u00a0|\u00a0 Posted 2013-05-31 Print this article Print\n\nGoogle is making it easier for tourists who want to travel by bicycle in Europe to plan their trips using Google Maps.\n\nGoogle Maps is again expanding its bicycling directions services for travelers by adding six more European nations to its roster of countries where the popular feature is available.\n\n\"Back in 2012, we added biking directions to our maps for a number of countries in Europe,\" wrote Kai Hansen, a Google product manager, in a May 27 post on the Google Europe Blog. \"It proved to be a popular feature among cycling amateurs and enthusiasts. We're now delighted to announce that we are now enabling biking directions in Google Maps for Germany, France, Poland, Ireland, Luxembourg and Liechtenstein.\"\n\nGoogle Maps first added biking directions to their maps for the United States and Canada in 2010. The 10 European nations added to the program in 2012 were Australia, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and the U.K. The directions are available using a desktop Web browser or through an Android mobile app that gives turn-by-turn and voice-guided directions in real time for travelers on the go.\n\nBy August 2012, more than 330,000 miles (equal to more than 530,000 kilometers, or half a gigameter) of bicycling routes were listed in Google Maps, according to Google. The dark-green lines on the maps show dedicated bike trails and paths where motor vehicles are not permitted, while light-green lines show streets with bike lanes. Dashed green lines show other streets recommended for cycling, and bicycling navigation services even help riders avoid steep hills.\n\n\"Like in other countries, we've added information about bike trails, lanes and recommended roads directly to the map,\" wrote Hansen about the newly added bicycling directions. \"In some countries, we've worked with partner organizations. In others, users have added hundreds of kilometers of biking paths through Google Mapmaker.\"\n\nThe Google directions for bicyclists provide routes that avoid busy streets and use suitable bike paths, according to Hansen. \"Time estimates for the route will be based on a complex set of variables accounting for the type of road, terrain and turns.\"\n\nTravelers can also add their own comments and input to the maps by contacting Google Maps or by using Google Map Maker, where ordinary citizens can add valuable cartographic details about locations and businesses on Google Maps.\u00a0 The entries are reviewed and must be approved before they are available to other users under the program.\n\nGoogle Map Maker, which launched in 2008, has been adding new nations since it began to bring the capabilities to many more users. It was launched in the United States in 2011 and today includes maps for more than 200 countries and regions, according to Google. The U.K. was added in April 2013.\n\nMap Maker allows amateur cartographers to visually mark locations and add detailed information to Google Maps data, which helps make Google's own maps even richer. Users can detail their favorite local restaurants, malls and shops, or even mark town bike lanes.

In 1988, he was picked up to perform on the improvisational comedy show, \"Whose Line Is It Anyway?\" The show would go on to be such a huge success in the UK that after a decade on the air, Whose Line Is It Anyway was brought to the U.S. market starring Drew Carey as the host. Thankfully, most of the original cast came with them overseas and Wayne Brady got his chance to shine in the American market. He would go on from there to host The Wayne Brady show and even won several daytime television awards for his performances and subject matter.

Over the course of his career, he's managed to rub elbows with some of the most famous celebrities appearing on television today. Among that wide list of celebrities that Wayne Brady is known to have worked with is Drew Carey, Colin Mochrie, Ryan Styles, Greg Proops, Brad Sherwood, Chip Esten, Denny Siegel, Kathy Kinney, Kathy Greenwood, Jeff Davis, Patrick Bristow, Stephen Colbert, Ian Gomez, Aisha Tyler, and more!

Don't miss out, get your tickets to see Wayne Brady perform today!\n\nWayne Brady Author\n\nThough he's accomplished much on the stage when it comes to his comedy, Wayne Brady is not known for being an impressive author. While he may have the skills and talents necessary to become a talented writer, he has always seemed to focus his energy towards his humor, a decision that has been to his benefit as he is now recognized as one of the finest comedians in his field in the world. Few comedians understand the necessity of honing one's craft in the same way that Wayne Brady does, because even though other comedians spend hours honing and crafting their jokes, Wayne Brady lives and breathes his comedy every second of every day.

As the center\u00b4s astronomers and scientists manage their own clusters without the support of an IT team, they selected Bright Cluster Manager because it offered a single, integrated solution that minimizes the complexity of deploying, scheduling, monitoring and managing high performance computing (HPC) clusters. In particular, Bright eliminated the need for creating custom scripts associated with open source cluster management solutions, or commercial solutions based on open source software.\n\nThe Shanghai Astronomical Observatory\u00b4s CGC cluster today comprises 50 CPU nodes, with plans to double the cluster to 100 nodes in next 12 months. Bright Cluster Manager will make it easy to expand their system without disrupting operations. CHPC Technology, a leading professional HPC software and services provider in China, led the cluster installation project.\n\n\u201cOur computational team focuses on developing numerical simulations using HPC computing, while our observational team gathers a tremendous amount of data from both spaced-based and land-based telescopes,\u201d said Professor Weipeng Lin, Associate Director at the Shanghai Astronomical Observatory\u00b4s Research Center for Galaxy and Cosmology. \u201cBright helps us manage our cluster with much less effort, so that we can concentrate on our investigation to better understand the formation and evolution of cosmic structures by comparing computational simulations with observational data.\u201d\n\n\u201cBright Cluster Manager is easier to install and manage than open source alternatives on the market,\u201d continued Professor Lin. \u201cBecause our scientists are also responsible for system administration, they are pleased to have a solution that allows them to spend less time on script-writing and more time on the science of understanding our universe.\u201d\n\nAbout Shanghai Astronomical Observatory:\n\nFounded in 1962, the Shanghai Astronomical Observatory, Chinese Academy of Sciences (SHAO), has four research departments including the Shanghai Center for Astro-geodynamics Research (SCAR), Center for Galaxy and Cosmology (CGC), Division of Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI), and Division of High Technology Laboratories (HTL). http://www.shao.ac.cn\n\nAbout China HPC Technology Co. Ltd. (CHPC)\n\nCHPC, an authorized Bright Cluster Manager reseller located in Shanghai, China, is a professional HPC application solutions and services provider. CHPC has partnered with many leading IT venders such as Cray, SGI, HP, NVIDIA, TMS and others to provide a broad line of low-cost, mid-range and high-end computing servers, data storage and software solutions in China. http://www.chpc-tech.com/\n\nAbout Bright Computing\n\nBright Computing specializes in management software for clusters, grids and clouds, including compute, storage, Hadoop and database clusters. Bright\u00b4s fundamental approach and intuitive interface makes cluster management easy, while providing powerful and complete management capabilities for increasing productivity.

Anyone have any tips on which food is best to eat at the fair? I noticed the bbq looked good, and I'm not too into the big turkey legs and nachos I saw others eating. I might settle on a hot dog. Any tips?\n\nI did enjoy the funnel cake, but I think next time I'll get it sans fruit and whipped cream. The toppings are good, but it makes the cake soggy, and I end up searching for only the crispy pieces. Anyone else ever get the funnel cake with just powdered sugar?\n\nAdditionally, if anyone can answer my parking question, I'd greatly appreciate it. How much time do you allot for traffic when leaving the fair? I (unfortunately) have to leave early in the evening, and I have no idea how much time to allot for getting us out of the parking lot and onto the I-5, and then whatever traffic could be on the freeway! How long did it take you to get home after leaving the fair at night? I have to leave around 8:00 p.m.\n\nThanks for reading!\n\n  1. Click to Upload a photo (10 MB limit)\n  1. Edit to add: If you have any experience parking in their 'preferred parking', please share. I'm considering whether to park in regular ($10) or preferred ($15) parking, based on which would get me out of the park faster.\n\n    3 Replies\n    1. re: crindy\n\n      As far as food goes, I always get a cream puff (the shells of the large ones are always made fresh) and an artichoke sandwich at Roxy's. I also had a blooming onion, ear of corn and meatballs on a stick (at Pignotti's). I have had the funnel cake in prior years and only get it with powdered sugar, although this year they are also making a red velvet funnel cake which everyone seemed to have. There is a list of the new Fair Foods here: http://www.sdfair.com/index.php?fusea...\n\n      Fourth of July is closing day and the most attended day of the run of the Fair (opening day has around 42K people and closing day around 100K). People are going there for the Fireworks and when you say you will be driving home, other parts of the County will all be gearing up for their Firework shows at 9 p.m. (the individual City shows are coordinated to match up with music played on several radio stations at the same time). You don't say where you live, but that route home and possible Fireworks displays along the way will determine the timing of your trip. (I live in Santee, but go to the Fair to be there at the gate opening the three times I went this year and I left the Fairgrounds around 3 p.m. each time. I parked in the Horse Park/free lot, which tacks on about 15 minutes, but being able to get off and then back on the bus right at the front gate and sit before having to drive home is helpful after walking around in the sun for a few miles). This is a list of the free parking areas (which have shuttle buses to and from running all day: http://www.sdfair.com/index.php?fusea... ) It is very efficient and I see they allow buses out of the parking lot and let them turn left (when autos can't) and holding up traffic of the regular cars leaving the lot.\n      When I do leave around 3 p.m., the parking lot close to the entrance is always full and the dirt lot across the street (which you also pay $10 for) where they are directing the cars to park is pretty full then also.\n\n      Maybe there is someone who leaves before the fireworks on the Fourth who can give you more specifics. I've never gone on that date.\n\n      1. re: Cathy\n\n        Thank you so much for your reply! I was planning on leaving at 8:00, in the hopes that I'll be in Carlsbad by 9:30. I have to be there at 9:30 :-(\n\n        1. re: Cathy\n\n          I also did think about whether taking the bus or the car would take less time. We have used the Mira Costa Cardiff parking/bus, but I assumed that parking there would be faster. I might consider doing that again, but a bus seems to move slower than my car...\n\n      2. When we went, it took us nearly 45 minutes to get in after getting in the \"line\" on the freeway. Getting out wasn't nearly as bad.\n\n        Regarding parking, we went at 2pm and we were told the Preferred Parking was full, so, if you want to go that route, you need to get there early. We could see there were spots available but there doesn't seem to be anyone patrolling the lot to make that determination.\n\n        I haven't had a funnel cake in years but I've never had it other than just powdered sugar.\n\n        4 Replies\n        1. re: phee\n\n          Thank you for your reply! Do you remember how you got into preferred parking? Is there a different entrance for that?\n\n          1. re: crindy\n\n            We never got into preferred parking - we were told it was full and there were signs up indicating it was full. However, when walking into the fair, we saw several open spots in the preferred parking area. As far as getting into preferred parking, just stay toward the right - you'll see the signs.\n\n            We did enjoy the fried artichoke hearts on a stick. Find those in the Plaza de Mexico. Pink's Hot Dogs - good snap, lots of options - if you haven't had one before, give 'em a try.\n\n            1. re: phee\n\n              I see, thanks for clarifying. Wow, artichoke hearts on a stick sound right up my alley. I wonder if they were served with some kind of aoili or sauce? I didn't know Pink's was there! Great tips, thank you!\n\n              1. re: crindy\n\n                There was a sauce in the bottom of the paper holder, but I thought they tasted best all by themselves. Have fun!\n\n        2. Did you see my post on the SD Fair?\n          Going on 4th of July from what I hear is horrific on all counts..parking, crowds, long waits..\n          I park across from the polo fields and take the bus over for free and its easy peasy and usually no waits.\n          You also, might want to park off property if you want to make a somewhat quick escape.\n          Leaving around 8pm does not guarantee it will be smooth sailing to Carlsbad..lots of revelers trying to get to their fireworks destination.\n          Food wise, the side of zucchini on the corner for $6 for 4 huge battered zuc is delicious and worth the money and you gussy it up with ranch and sirrachi sauce...located on the main drag next to the car display...grilled char corn is good, artichoke hearts, turkey corn dog and happy hour at the paddock bar but the bartenders are surly pricks, so put on your game face.\n          Things are very expensive everywhere and for crap food, I would pass on most stuff.\n\n          2 Replies\n          1. re: Beach Chick\n\n            Hi Beach Chick! I clicked on your name and found your post about the Tuesday two buck taste thing. Didn't know there were lobster rolls! Artichoke hearts sound great.\n\n            I'm considering taking the bus from my local Mira Costa. I've decided to leave at 7 pm! Thank you for your reply!\n\n            1. re: crindy\n\n              Take the bus from Mira Costa and tell the driver you want off at the back gate They have been letting people off in the back this year. Unless your tickets are at will call then you are stuck. It really is crazy crowded. The food lines are not that bad once you are in the fair. The best deal bar none is the carved sandwiches at surfside race place and you can get splits of chandon there, you gotta be 18 to enter."}

Hardly.\n\nAfter the most money-drenched elections in history -- with close to $6 billion spent on the 2012 presidential and Congressional races alone, by one estimate -- big donors and the media alike are now asking: Was it worth it?\n\nIt's a fair question, especially for the new breed of super PACs and other outside groups that unleashed $1 billion this cycle on federal races. More than $715 million of that came from conservative groups attacking President Obama, who handily won a second term, and Congressional Democrats, who only strengthened their grip in the Senate.\n\nDemocrats are now relishing stories of Republican strategist Karl Rove having to explain to donors how two groups he co-founded, American Crossroads and Crossroads GPS, spent more than $175 million but only won 12 out of the 45 federal races they targeted -- a dismal 27 percent success rate.\n\nThey're not alone: FreedomWorks for America, the Tea Party super PAC founded by former House Majority Leader Dick Armey (R-TX) spent $19 million and lost all of its top-tier Congressional races, including a $2.9 million effort to unseat Sen. Bill Nelson (D-FL).\n\nBut do these setbacks for the Republican super PACs mean that Big Money didn't have an impact in the 2012 elections? Did all that money just go to waste? Hardly.\n\n\nFirst, let's step back and look at what money can (and can't) do in an election. For example, about $3 billion of election dollars go to air TV ads, which by all accounts are blunt political tools, expensive and inefficient in influencing elections.\n\nAs Daniel Adler of Rolling Stone noted in his valuable assessment of political ads earlier this year, TV ads don't seem to have an impact on most people, and whatever effects they do have are usually short-lived. So why do strategists still blow so much money on them? Because, as Adler concludes, \"ads actually do work -- or work well enough, enough of the time.\"\n\nThe key is the audience: Ads seem to work best on voters who don't know much about the issues or candidates. This includes undecided voters, that small sliver of the electorate that comedian Steven Colbert joked \"don\u2019t think about what they want until they get right up to the register at McDonald\u2019s.\"\n\nAccording to Kathleen Hall Jamieson of the Annenberg Public Policy Center, data on TV ads in battleground states going back to 2000 suggests ads have changed the minds of some voters -- at least enough to influence, if not determine, the result.\n\nOr as Joe Heim, political science professor at the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse, says: \"[Political advertising] does have an impact, even if it\u2019s a marginal one. And that marginal impact is worth it.\"\n\nBut ads are just one arrow in a political strategist's quiver -- and while they can move the needle of voter opinion, they can't erase other shortcomings. Equally important are the ground game of getting out the vote, the overall message a campaign projects, and, of course, who's running for office: American Crossroads spokesman Jonathan Collegio testily blamed their recent Senate losses on \"sub-optimal candidate quality.\"\n\n\nThe fact that TV ads are most effective with less-engaged voters might explain money's continuing influence in state and local races, which receive far less media exposure and voters may know even less about the candidates and issues.\n\n\nThat put N.C. Republicans in charge of the once-a-decade redistricting process, producing new maps which the John Locke Foundation -- which is largely funded by Pope's foundation -- readily admits were crucial to enabling the GOP to expand its power in the General Assembly in 2012.\n\n\nOf the top 10 spending groups in North Carolina -- which made up more than 90 percent of the $14 million total -- seven were Republican-leaning groups, who outspent their Democratic-leaning counterparts by more than a two-to-one margin.\n\n\n\nMoney may have had the most influence in the election for a N.C. Supreme Court seat -- a race where many voters didn't know much about the candidates beyond what they saw in ads. The race attracted an unprecedented $2.3 million in outside spending, 88 percent of which came from super PACs supporting conservative incumbent Paul Newby, including a last-minute attack ad described by one newspaper as sleazy. Despite trailing in the polls, Newby ended up winning with 51.9 percent of the vote.\n\nAs Facing South reported this week, money appears to have also been a factor in the GOP's capture of the Arkansas legislature for the first time in over a century; the billionaire Koch brothers had pledged to spend $1 million helping Republicans in the state. The Center for Public Integrity sees money also playing a big role in state races in Montana and Washington.\n\n\nIn other words, while a handful of rueful mega-donors may wish they'd kept their cash, the notion that Big Money spending was \"nearly for naught\" in 2012 doesn't hold up.\n\nIndeed, the reality may be that super PACs are what helped keep the presidential race as close as it was. Vanderbilt University's Ad Rating Project -- one of the first systematic efforts to track the impact of TV ads -- found that Romney's August 2012 \"Right Choice,\" attacking Obama (falsely) on welfare to work requirements, hit a nerve with independent voters.\n\nAnd that doesn't include the larger impact of money on the political system. As Jamelle Bouie at The Washington Post notes, \"the mere possibility that Super PACs may spend big in elections will change the landscape of American politics -- who runs, how they run, and what they run on -- in ways that are, at the moment, subtle and hard to predict.\"\n\nBig Money may have suffered a few setbacks -- but it's not going anywhere. And chances are that in the next election cyce, the money arms race will be bigger than ever.\n\nChris Kromm\n\n\nShare This Article\n\nMore in:"}

Lochte touched just nine-hundredths of a second behind, 1:54.93.\n\n\u201cA win is a win,\u201d Phelps said, moments afterward, still breathing hard, adding, \u201cIt feels good to be back on that side.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure that\u2019s not going to be the end of us going back-and-forth. So I\u2019m just happy to have a good race like that. Kind of pulled it all together.\u201d\n\nThe victory reversed the order of last year\u2019s 1-2 at the world championships in Shanghai, when Lochte not only won but set a world record in the 200 IM, 1:54 flat. It sets the stage for London and the Olympics just weeks from now.\n\nMoreover, the race came amid a fascinating day of maneuvering by Lochte, who opted Saturday night not only to swim the 200 IM but to sandwich that swim between the final of the 200 backstroke and the semifinal of 100 butterfly, all within about an hour.\n\nPhelps did not swim the 200 back. But he has for years been the boss of the 100 fly, and Lochte traditionally does not swim that event at major events, making it all the more intriguing that he would want to test himself in it.\n\nPhelps is the 2004 and 2008 Olympic 200 IM champion. But in recent years Lochte has been the king of the 200 medley. He won it at the 2009 Rome and 2011 Shanghai worlds.\n\nPhelps showed up in Shanghai in so-so shape. Lochte not only beat Phelps in the 200 IM but in the 200 free. Phelps freely acknowledged afterward that if he wanted to win, he needed to put in the work.\n\nThis past March, Lochte had told ESPN The Magazine, \u201cOnce I was able to beat Michael, it gave me a motivation, an edge. I told myself, I can do this. Once I beat someone, they won\u2019t beat me again.\u201d\n\nUmm, OK.\n\nHere, these Trials kicked off with Lochte defeating Phelps in the 400 IM. That was Lochte\u2019s first-ever victory over Phelps.\n\nThen, though, Phelps beat Lochte in the 200 free.\n\nThe mental what-do-you-have-for-me-now took an intriguing turn Saturday morning when \u201cRyan Lochte\u201d turned up for real on the heat sheets of the 100 fly and, indeed, Ryan Lochte swam in the prelims.\n\nPhelps, to no one\u2019s surprise, was the fastest qualifier, in 51.8. Lochte was sixth, in 52.21.\n\nThe 100 fly is a staple on the Phelps program. Phelps is the gold medalist in the 100 fly in the 2004 and 2008 Olympics and the 2007 Melbourne, 2009 and 2011 world championships.\n\nThe 100 fly is typically not Lochte\u2019s event. Yet all of a sudden he was swimming it? Because \u2014 why?\u00a0The schedule was, in a word, compressed.\n\nAt 7:15 p.m Friday, Lochte swam in the 200 back finals. He touched first, in 1:54.54, with Tyler Clary second, 26-hundredths behind.\n\nLochte got out of the water, waved to the crowd and walked right off the pool deck.\n\nAt 7:45, 28 minutes later, he was back up top, for the 200 IM.\n\nPhelps went out hard from the start, saying, \u201cI had to.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cI kind of used Ryan having the 200 back before to set the pace early. You know, I know the 200 back \u2026 is a very tough race. And I know it takes a lot out of your legs. I wanted to jump on it in the first 100 and see what happened.\n\n\u201cBut I think our backstroke we kind of let off it a little bit and we were playing a cat-and-mouse game again. And then of course the last 50 we just went crazy.\u201d\n\nThe 200 IM ended at 7:47.\n\nAt 8, they held the 200 back medal ceremony.\n\nAt 8:12, Lochte was back on the blocks for his semifinal heat in the 100 fly. He finished third, in 52.47, enough for a spot in Sunday\u2019s final.\n\nPhelps, in the other semifinal, finished first, in 51.35.\n\n\u201cTonight,\u201d Lochte said, \u201cwas probably the most pain I have ever endured in a swimming competition.\n\n\u201cGoing back-to-back-to-back was definitely hard. You know, I was up for the challenge. It is something I have been training for \u2014 for\u00a0the last four years. I knew I was able to do it. The 100 fly was just a different event, an event I have never done before.\u201d\n\nAnd, he said, \u201cYes, I am swimming it [Sunday],\u201d in the final.\n\nWith all these numbers, here\u2019s one more bit of math, and perhaps the explanation behind Lochte\u2019s Saturday\u2019s triple. For reasons yet unexplained, he scratched out of the 100 back at the Trials. That leaves the 100 fly if he wants to medal in five individual events at the Games \u2014 the 100 fly plus both medleys, the 200 back and the 200 free. Throw in three relays \u2014 that\u2019s a big if, by the way, that he would necessarily swim in all three \u2014 and you get eight.\n\nEight is precisely how many events Phelps swam in Beijing, winning eight gold medals.\n\nEight is also precisely the number of events Phelps is now on course to swim in London \u2014 assuming, of course, he finishes first or second in the 100 fly Sunday night.\n\n\u201cI actually never thought I would ever try it again,\u201d Phelps said late Saturday.\n\nHe also said, when asked about a \u201crivalry\u201d with Lochte, \u201cYou guys are going to get the same answer you always get. Sorry. Neither of us wants to lose. When we get in the water, we race as hard as we can.\u201d\n\nPhelps said he is concentrating now on \u201csmaller things,\u201d slamming his feet over faster on his backstroke-to-breaststroke turn in the medley, keeping his hands together during his breaststroke legs, things like that.\n\nHis longtime coach, Bob Bowman, said a couple days ago, \u201cHe is finishing everything well but he\u2019s not particularly sharp. I like that,\u201d because there are still weeks to go before London, time to hone that sharpness.\n\nAssuming Phelps wins the 100 fly final, Phelps and Lochte will leave Omaha knowing that\u00a0Phelps won three of four head-to-head here.\n\nAt the same time, they both know as well that what happened at the Trials, when they write the history books, will mean \u2014 well, very little.\n\nWith age comes wisdom, right? Michael Phelps, 27, said, looking ahead toward London, \u201cThe next race is the one that counts.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Plusone Tumblremail\n\nTags: , ,\n\nAbout the Author\n\n\n2 Responses to Happy 27th birthday, Michael Phelps\n\n  1.

{"dataman_score": 3.0, "text": "- - Sunday, December 9, 2012\n\n\nNothing could be more intellectually fashionable these days than the idea that the middle ground is where the solution to all problems can be found, particularly when it comes to the ailing U.S. economy. But \u201ccompromise,\u201d the New Oxford American Dictionary tells us, has another meaning: \u201cthe acceptance of standards that are lower than is desirable.\u201d\n\nNothing better describes the \u201cbalanced approach\u201d that President Obama is trying to foist onto the country as a solution to a deteriorating economy, a deterioration that is rapidly reaching crisis proportions. For despite the manipulation of the news courtesy of NPR and the other usual media suspects, we are in fact seeing no progress out of stagnation.\n\nThe grim truth is that 350,000 wage earners left the U.S. labor pool in November. And that, more than anything else, explains why the U.S. unemployment figure for November fell to 7.7 percent. Indeed, some 23 million Americans are now out of work, with many having given up hope. It\u2019s no wonder that the indexes of misery \u2014 applications for disability payments and food stamps \u2014 have snowballed to record highs, at a pace that threatens to complete the bankruptcy of the nation\u2019s finances.\n\nWhite House chicanery is reflected in moving the fiscal goal posts, doubling down on the demand for tax rate hikes of those Mr. Obama proffered during the campaign.The president plays down the simple fact that most small businesses file personal income tax statements, which means the so-called \u201criches\u201d he targets represent total business revenue rather than net income. He has offered the sketchiest outlines for budget cutting, with phantom savings such as ending the costs of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nIn fact, calls for \u201cstimulus\u201d spending in the president\u2019s plan far exceed his vague proposed cutbacks. Nor has the White House thrown onto the negotiating table the two monsters crippling the fiscal health of the country, Medicare and Social Security.\n\nFour years of Obamanomics have taught us one simple lesson: It does not work. The U.S. cannot borrow and spend its way out of the most severe business cycle since the 1930s. It cannot do it any more than could Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s, whose far more sophisticated team of advisers tried to \u201cprime the pump\u201d for the better part of a decade. The country did not exit the Great Depression until the war mobilization after Pearl Harbor.\n\nBut if FDR\u2019s notorious Work Progress Administration became an synonym for incompetence in the 1930s, Mr. Obama\u2019s billions of dollars squandered on alternative energy projects have given a new meaning to \u201cgreen\u201d investing. Ironically, despite everything the administration has done to hobble domestic energy production, the shale revolution is producing record levels of oil and gas \u2014 on private land. The avalanche of new regulations from the Obama administration\u2019s Environmental Protection Agency is trying, desperately, to choke that off as well.\n\nThus, the call for House Republicans to meet the president \u201chalfway\u201d in the budget talks is a siren song for continued disaster. Washington\u2019s problem is spending, not revenues, a spending spree that, even in this economy, will set records in 2012.\n\nThis republic was, in fact, not initiated on compromise. The War for Independence against British tyranny was waged by radicals who were mindful that at least a third of their fellow countrymen were either hostile to the struggle or sitting it out. Yes, there were successful if bitter negotiations during the secret \u2014 repeat secret \u2014 Constitutional Convention sessions in that hot summer of 1787. But there were also \u201ccompromises,\u201d such as the almost undebated decision to count black slaves as three-fifths of a person for census purposes, a compromise that would lead to bloodshed less than a century later.\n\nThe Obama campaign continues unabated and unabashed. It may well be that the president has succeeded where no other U.S. politician has in introducing the concept of European class warfare into an American political culture based on equality of opportunity, not equality of outcomes. The Obama campaign\u2019s appeal to superficiality and demonization continues the only theme of the president\u2019s message: If he succeeds in selling it to the American public, we will indeed have made The Compromise.\n"}

However, if your adjusted gross income, or AGI, exceeds a certain amount, the exemption is phased out. For bonds cashed in 2007, the exemption begins to disappear when the joint AGI is $98,400 or $65,600 for a single parent. The exemption completely disappears if the joint AGI is $128,400 or $80,600 for a single. These figures are adjusted annually for inflation.\n\nA new online program\nI and EE bonds were once sold and redeemed solely as a paper security, but now they're available in electronic form. As a TreasuryDirect account holder, you can buy, manage and redeem I and EE bonds online.\n\nA new program called Smart Exchange allows TreasuryDirect account owners to convert their Series E, EE and I paper savings bonds to electronic securities in a special conversion linked account within their online account.\n\nWhen you purchase bonds this way, the bonds are:\n$30,000 maximum purchase in one calendar year.\nIssued electronically to your designated account.\n\nIf you redeem I or EE bonds within the first five years, you'll forfeit the three most recent months' interest. After five years, you won't be penalized.\n\nCustodial accounts\nWhen parents can afford to pay for their child's college education or the family's income is too high to receive financial aid, it is time to consider a custodial account. Known as the Uniform Transfer to Minors Act, or UTMA, or Uniform Gifts to Minors Act, or UGMA, accounts, they offer the most flexibility and up to $850 a year in tax-free earnings. Any family member can contribute to these accounts. Withdrawals can be made at any time without penalties.\n\nThere is one potentially significant drawback: Money in a custodial account is an income-producing asset of the child, so it will be difficult to qualify for need-based financial aid. In addition, your child will have complete control of the money once he or she reaches the age of 18 (in most states). If your child decides to blow the money on a trip to Europe instead of using it for educational purposes, there is nothing you can do to legally stop him or her.\n\n-- Posted: July 2, 2007\n<< Previous article | Next article >>\nPage | 1 | 2 |\n\n- advertisement -\n- advertisement -\n- advertisement -\n\nNYSE: RATE | RSS Feeds |\n"}

Faith is where the Promises and Work of God are made real to His redeemed. A.Ephesians 2:8-9, We are saved by faith.\nB.Rom. 1:17, We live by faith.\nC.Rom. 4:13, We receive righteousness by faith.\nD.Rom. 5:1, We are justified in Christ by faith\nE.Rom. 5:2, We have access to God's grace by faith.\nF.2 Cor. 1:24, We stand firm in our belief by faith.\nG.Gal. 3:14, We receive the promise of the Spirit by faith.\nH.1 Tim. 1:4, We do God's work by faith.\nI.Gal. 5:5, We wait for the return of Christ by faith.\nJ.Indeed, faith is very important; it is vital to the Christian.\n\n2.What is Faith? A.According to Webster's Dictionary faith is \"an unquestioning belief that does not require proof or evidence.\"\nB.Though Webster's Dictionary says we don'tneed evidence to have faith, as Christians we do have evidence for our faith. i. a.We have the Bible: 66 books, 40 authors, written in 3 languages, over 1600 years, prophecy, and moral and spiritual truth,\nb.We have the resurrection of Jesus; confidence in His words, and evidence of God's truth in our lives.\n\nii.The nearest definition we have in the Bible of what faith is is found right here in Hebrews 11:1\niv.The KJV and the NKJV say, \"Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.\"\nv.The RSV, NRSV and NASB each says, \"Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen.\" a.Literally the Greek of Hebrews 11:1 says, \"Now faith is the reality of things being hoped for, the proof of things not being seen.\"\nb.But the English does not carry the full meaning of the verse. That is why it is good to examine several translations of the verse to try to get a better understanding.\n\nC.An important point, though, is that faith is only as good as the object in which it is placed. i.All the faith in the world in someone false won'thelp you.\n\n3.But how does faith affect your lives? A.You get in the car and drive on faith. You don'' know if you''re going to make it to your destination alive or not, but you go.\nB.You have faith that the food you buy that is grown by strangers is not harmful, so you eat it.\nC.You have faith that the doctors you see are competent. So you put yourself in their hands.\nD.If you did not have faith, if you did not trust others you wouldn'tbe able to drive, eat, or get help in times of sickness. Your life would be very difficult.\nE.Let's look at this chapter a bit and see how faith affected the people of God.\nF.Hebrews 11:4 says, \"By faith Abel offered God a better sacrifice than Cain did. By faith he was commended as a righteous man, when God spoke well of his offerings. And by faith he still speaks, even though he is dead.\" (NIV) i.We do not know many details of Abel's faith. a.We do not know just how much was revealed to him.\n\nii.But we do know that his faith caused him to worship God. a.He picked the best of his flock to sacrifice to God. \"and Abel brought of the firstlings of his flock and of their fat portions. And the LORD had regard for Abel and his offering, (Genesis 4:4, RSV).\nb.He brought it to the place of sacrifice. It was natural for Abel's faith in God to manifest itself in a blood sacrifice, a sacrifice that pointed to the Messiah.\n\niii.It was natural for Abel to worship. a.There is something wrong with the Christian who does not worship.\nb.Faith looks for opportunities to worship.\n\n4.Faith made Enoch walk with God, v. 5 A.\"By faith Enoch was taken from this life, so that he did not experience death; he could not be found, because God had taken him away. For before he was taken, he was commended as one who pleased God\" (Hebrews 11:5, NIV).\nB.In Genesis it says, \"And after he became the father of Methuselah, Enoch walked with God 300 years and had other sons and daughters. 23Altogether, Enoch lived 365 years. 24Enoch walked with God; then he was no more, because God took him away\" (Genesis 5:22-24).\nC.Your walk will change if you continue to trust in Christ i.2 Corinthians 5:17 says, \"Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old has gone, the new has come!\" (NIV).\n\nD.Enoch pleased God. Is God pleased with you? i.Is God pleased with the places you choose for recreation?\nii.Is God pleased with the books you read? with what you watch on T.V.?\niii.Is God pleased with the words you use? the conversations you have?\niv.Is God pleased with the plans you''ve made for your future?\n\nE.Enoch's walk of faith delivered him from death. i.Your walk of faith has already delivered you from death, the death called damnation.\nii.Your faith is in Jesus; therefore, there is no death to come to you.\n\n5.Faith made Noah work for God, v. 7. A.We have in Gen. 6, the tragic story of the decline of humanity into sin.\nB.But God's grace triumphs: God saves Noah (v. 8).\nC.In Noah, his faith manifested itself in real works. James 2:26 says, \"As the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without deeds is dead.\" i.Noah built an ark because he believed in God\nii.Every swing of his axe said, \"faith.\"\niii.Every felled tree said, \"faith.\"\niv.Every swing of his hammer said, \"faith.:\n\nD.Faith will make you work today\nE.Faith is not something for long ago; for trusting in Jesus for salvation and not trusting Him for anything else. It means you trust Him for everything--even when it is difficult sometimes. It means that every day you continue to trust Him and that you continue to manifest the fruit of your faith. i.Caring, sharing, witnessing, forgiving, helping, etc. In these things you please God.\niii.Faith connects you to God; it is your admission that you are dependent upon Him; that your hope is in Him. It pleases Him, because it is Him you are trusting and no one and nothing else.\n\n6.Much more could be said about this chapter. By faith Abraham, by faith Isaac, by faith Jacob, by faith Joseph, by faith Moses, by faith Rehab, A.By faith: we understand the universe was formed; people offered sacrifices; humanity was saved; people left their lands and moved; blessings were given; people were freed; death was escaped; and walls fell; and verse 32 \"And what more shall I say? I do not have time to tell about Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, David, Samuel and the prophets,\" (NIV).\n\n\nFaith is vitally important in the life of the Christian. It is by faith that you are saved; you are justified; cleansed, and look forward to the return of Jesus. Faith is where you please God, admit your dependence upon Him, and continually seek to rely upon Him and His grace. I would like to close by asking you these question: \"What has faith changed in your life? What are faith's evidences in your life? Is faith growing in your life."}
{"dataman_score": 4.0, "text": "I need some peace and quiet. Today at work \u2014 Starbucks \u2014 was extremely busy with not enough staff, and yay the customers were just THRILLED about the inevitable wait times. On days like that I\u2019m mentally DRAINED and I just fall unconcious when I go to bed.\n\nSo this seemed like a perfect opportunity to give this tea a try! The reason white tea appeals to me in the first place is that it just gives me this image of utter calm and relaxation: sipping slowly and closing your eyes as each delicate flavor gently washes over your tastebuds. The smell of this tea is very refreshing, so that seems like the perfect combination for what I need right now.\n\nThe tea leaves are very beautiful. The white leaves have that fuzzy look that white tea is so known for. There are very pretty pink buds in there as well that I didn\u2019t notice while scooping into the infuser. There are real chunks of pineapple in this. You know we live in a scary artifical chemical world when for a moment you\u2019re thinking \u201c\u2026 what are those?\u201d and then being absolutely stunned that there\u2019s actual pineapple in there.\n\nSo I want to give Stacy a quick thankyou for your natural teas. It\u2019s impossible to avoid all chemicals in our foods and drinks nowadays, so it\u2019s very comforting knowing that there still are options for some things at least.\n\nAnyway, the smell of the steeped tea is as refreshing as the leaves. Perhaps a little stronger. The liquor is a pleasant yellow, deep but not opaque.\n\nThere\u2019s a burst of pineapple taste, that\u2019s both juicy and a little tart, which is perfectly accented by the cilantro that gives it a little punch. It doesn\u2019t taste LIKE cilantro, but it adds a lot of complexity to the flavor; if you somehow had a sip without the cilantro it would be noticed and missed. The pineapple is the first part of the tea that grabs your attention, which is then gently followed by the delicate taste of the Bai Mu Dan which is every bit as soothing as I hoped. At the swallow a pleasantly tart \u2014 but not puckering \u2014 pineapply taste lingers at the back of your tongue.\n\nI\u2019m impressed at how much this tea is bursting with flavor (I don\u2019t sweeten my white teas mind you) and yet doesn\u2019t assault your tastebuds either. It\u2019s exactly what I needed right now. I think after the second infusion I\u2019ll make up a cup of Cantaloupe and Cream also by Butiki.\n\nFrom now on after a a busy Sunday, I think I\u2019ll make my first tea upon returning home to be a white. I can feel my frustration and stress being lifted away with each sip.\n\n185 \u00b0F / 85 \u00b0C 3 min, 30 sec\n\nLogin or sign up to leave a comment.\n\nPeople who liked this\n\nLogin or sign up to leave a comment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing These People\n\nModerator Tools\n\nMark as Spammer"}

Toronto) >\nAug 2, 2008 01:59 PM\n\nGreat Authentic Chinese Rest uptown?\n\nWe used to go to this restaurant at Kennedy/Hwy 7, geesh, forget the name, but it's changed hands now - used to be right next to a bakery - ok, that's not much help is it? Name fails me:( You could pick several dishes for a set price and the cash stand and roast duck set up was in front to the left as you walk in. There was also a higher raised area towards the back of the restaurant for seating. Ok, I'm babblling on - obviously don't want to go back to this place - unless it's changed hands again.\n\nLooking for a nice, clean restaurant anywhere in Scarborough, Markham, North York, Richmond Hill area that has authentic Chinese food (chinese soup, etc). Most places have the best dishes written in Chinese - unfortunatley, unless I go with friends/relatives that can read, I'm out of look.\n\nAny recommendations would be great!\n\nAs always, thanks fellow Chows!\n\n  1. Click to Upload a photo (10 MB limit)\n  1. Szechuan Legend - 3280 Midland Ave\n\n    This spot is VERY authentic, clean, busy, and offers some of the most delicious Chinese food in Toronto.\n\n    3 Replies\n    1. re: JonasBrand\n\n      Just a note, the OP mentioned \"pick several dishes for a set price\" which is only popular among Cantonese restos. But since dragon did not specify a regional cuisine, this might well be a good suggestion.\n\n      1. re: Teep\n\n        Hi Teep, thanks, you're right, I was looking more for a Chinese restaurant that has steamed fish, chinese soup, etc.\n\n        Jonasbrand: I've been to Szechuand Legend, thanks. I believe it has more of a Shanghainese type cuisine, not quite what I was looking for, but thanks.\n\n        1. re: red dragon\n\n          Dragon, then it would help if you specify Cantonese, which is \"Southern Chinese\". Szechuan and Shanghainese are \"Northern Chinese\"\n\n    2. Hi Red_Dragon,\n\n      By focusing only on clean restaurants - you may be limiting your choices, unfortunately! (LOL) Many of the best tasting Chinese restaurants require you to get your hands dirty.\n      My go-to favourite for Cantonese Chinese Dinner (make sure you only go for dinner, their dim sum, IMO, is inedible) is Ruby Chinese Restaurant. It's located in Woodside Mall at McCowan and Finch in Scarborough. The price is reasonable and the portions are large. The decor leaves something to be desired, but I just go for the food. My favourite dish there is their Lotus Leaf Steamed Fried Rice (here is a take-out food shot of it: http://www.flickr.com/photos/28531775...), but their dishes are all pretty consistently strong, especially their vegetable dishes (try their King Mushroom vegetable dish), and fish maw soup. I prefer Cantonese cuisine, rather than Szechuan, so all of my recommendations will lean towards the former rather than latter.\n\n      My favourite place to go for Congee and super cheap weekday lunches would be Fantasy Eatery (near Midland and Finch - 3320 Midland Avenue, Scarborough). $5 will get you some Pay-Dan Sow Yook Jook (phonetic translation), which is preserved duck egg with lean pork congee, AS WELL as Gon Chow Sam See Haw (3 veggie Fried Rice Noodle). It's one of my favourite congee joints in the city - and at $5, you cannot really beat it. Unfortunately, this menu is only in Chinese. Try ordering by phonetic translation - though if I remember it correctly, it's #7 for the congee lunch set meals. I would have to put a disclaimer on it that the place appears to have been decorated by a marble-happy 5-year old, and it is certainly not the cleanest place. However, the weekday lunch special is great value. Another fave would be the Ruby Restaurant I mentioned earlier - but only for their Noodle Soups and congee. For $5 you can have a tasty Noodle Soup with either Roast Pork, Roast Duck, Soya Chicken, or Roast Chicken on top with a few slices of veggies. Their broth is one of the strong broths I've had in T.O. Another winning lunch dish they have is their Fresh Fish Congee, which is served at the front of the restaurant at a service stall (approximately $4.50). The menus for these items are in English, and the congee, you can walk straight to the front of the restaurant and point to it yourself to order.\n\n      Many people also seem to like Casa Imperial, though I would have to say that I am not particularly a fan. The decor tries hard, but it really needs to be updated/refurbished IMO. It's located in the old Devonsleigh restaurant location at Steeles near T&T at 4125 Steeles Ave). A better, choice would be at Hwy 7 (8500 Warden Avenue) at the Hilton Suites named Empire Court (I neglected to bring my camera that time). Their dim sum is a bit higher class than your average joint, with prices to match. The decor is quite pleasant though. Spring Villa at 7301 Woodbine Ave, Markham, is another decent choice. It's clean and the food is above par.\n\n      Bean Curd Roll: http://www.flickr.com/photos/28531775...\n      Veggie Dumpling: http://www.flickr.com/photos/28531775...\n      Soup Dumpling: http://www.flickr.com/photos/28531775...\n      Lotus Leaf Sticky Rice: http://www.flickr.com/photos/28531775...\n      Egg Custard Bun: http://www.flickr.com/photos/28531775...\n      Eel Pastry: http://www.flickr.com/photos/28531775...\n      Vermicelli: http://www.flickr.com/photos/28531775...\n\n      Another favourite of mine would be Lotus Pond Vegetarian Restaurant. Their dim sum is one of my favourites in the area - especially if I feel like vegetarian fare. I have made another post elsewhere on chowhound, but here are some photos of their dim sum:\n      Curry Patty: http://www.flickr.com/photos/28531775...\n      Veggie Dumpling in Soup: http://www.flickr.com/photos/28531775...\n      The restaurant is very clean and the service is efficient and friendly. All menus are in English, as well, a couple of the waitresses speak English very proficiently. Click on my name to find my other Lotus post with photos and a discussion by other Chowhounders.\n\n      To be honest, I hardly go to these restaurants because I find myself always heading out West to the Doubletree (near the airport) for Grand Chinese Cuisine. I'll try to make a big post about it later this week (haven't gotten a chance to write up a big review yet. Here's one picture of the calamari: http://www.flickr.com/photos/28531775... and the veggie dumpling: http://www.flickr.com/photos/28531775... ). It's been my favourite dim sum place for the past year, and whenever I feel like dim sum, it fits the bill. However, it's not in the area that you mentioned as a criteria. If you ever get a chance to make it out there though, I highly recommend it. It's on par with Lai Wah Heen (IMO - though I'm sure others would say Lai Wah Heen is a tad better. Here is a photo of Lai Wah Heen's\n      crab tart: http://www.flickr.com/photos/28531775...\n      egg custard tart:\n      ), and is about 20% cheaper.\n\n      Let me know how it goes.\n      Cheers and Happy Eating!\n\n      48 Replies\n      1. re: BokChoi\n\n        Another one to check out is Maple Yip (4227 Sheppard Avenue East). I've only been there a couple of times a few years back and wasn't too impressed, but many others have said they love it there. Maybe it has since gotten better (?). It's in the back of a small strip mall in Scarborough.\n\n        1. re: BokChoi\n\n          Don't get me started on Maple Yip. We wasted one of our three dinners in Toronto over there. We could have gone to any restaurant in First Markham Place on Highway 7 (including the food court) and done better. Over there, Diamond Banquet Hall would be my first choice, and I do like Casa Imperial though it's a little pricey.\n\n          1. re: Chandavkl\n\n            I agree on Maple Yip. Food can be had at better places, and at better prices.. perhaps more bang for the buck.\n\n            1. re: jennjen18\n\n              Mind listing the places that have both better food AND better prices than Maple Yip? There are definitely places that are better, but the cost is higher. There are definitely also places that are cheaper, but the food isn't as good.\n\n              1. re: kwong\n\n                The Fantasy Eatery at Finch/Midland for one. Also, Tanchikee on Hwy #7 would be another. Both cheaper than Maple Yip but fairly similar food quality. The restaurant on Finch just east of Bayview ( same plaza as Maxim ) is pretty good too.\n\n                1. re: Charles Yu\n\n                  Fantasy Eatery does have better food, but I find the portion sizes are smaller, which makes them more expensive.\n\n                  Where along Hwy 7 is Tanchikee? I'll try it out the next time my parents come by.\n\n                  Regarding the restaurant in the Maxim plaza:\n                  1) Is it better than Maple Yip?\n                  2) Is it cheaper than Maple Yip?\n                  3) What is the name of this place?\n\n                  Are there any other examples of places that are both better AND cheaper than Maple Yip?\n\n                  1. re: kwong\n\n                    I dont think Fantasy Eatery is expensive at all, really. If you're going with a buddy, it's perfect. In fact, you're not paying for food that you're not eating.. most dishes are under $10. Although from what my mom tells me, all dishes have gone $0.50 up due to inflation! But still, I think that Fantasy Eatery satisfies what youre looking for, though it doesn't have set meals, you could easily make up the set meal by ordering a la carte, which isnt expensive at all.\n\n                    One of my favourites is the eggplant olive and minced pork pot.. it fills the whole rectangular styrofoam container, and comes in at just $10 or so. It lasts me for a week, even. I mean, if you're talking about going to the Grand or something like that, why not try this little eatery?\n\n                    1. re: jennjen18\n\n                      I don't understand what you mean when you say \"why not try this little eatery\" because I have tried it already. In fact, the eggplant hot pot dish is one of my favorites there too!\n\n                      1. re: kwong\n\n                        Umm, i was responding to the OP... sorry to confuse.\n\n                    2. re: kwong\n\n                      If you find Fantasy Eatery, one of the most reasonably priced good Chinese restaurant expensive, then I'm not sure what to recommend to you?! Any cheaper and I'm sure food quality will be compromised by the use of inferior ingredients!\n\n                      Tanchikee is at the corner of Chalmers and Hwy7\n\n                      The restaurant in the Maxim plaza is called 'Sun Star'. Food, depending on dishes ordered can be very good. On average, price is cheaper than Maple Yip, but again it depends on what you order!\n\n                      A typical Cantonese sweet and sour pork ( Gool Lo Yoak ) cost around $20 in higher end restaurants, around $10 in O'Mei and Maple Yip and only $6 in Fantasy Eatery/Tanchikee. Any place charging cheaper than the latter and the restaurant has to lose money!!!\n\n                      1. re: Charles Yu\n\n                        Hey Charles, I was waiting for you to give Sun Star a try... did you order their roast pigeon? My friend who lives in Toronto (but travels to HK a lot for good food) recommended the place to me. I haven't had roast pigeon in GTA too often, so I can't compare it to other places. Did you also come across any other good dishes? I found their sweet & sour pork to be a bit lacking in sour tanginess that I look for.\n\n                        Here's an older link I posted about some of the other dishes I tried there.\n\n\n                        1. re: Royaljelly\n\n                          Hello Royaljelly! Eating out with the baby yet?\n\n                          Tried out Sun Star again tonight. Finally have a chance to order their Roast Pigeon. It was good. Pretty moist meat and crispy skin. However, at $18, its a bit overpriced. Prefer Full House version instead. However, we did ordered two 'stunningly delicious' dishes. One is Braised eggplant with Enoki mushroom in oyster sauce. Simply prepared but ultra tasty. The other dish was Wok fried mixed mushrooms, scallions and fillet of veal. The 'wok-hay' was phenomenal resulting in the veal cooked really tender and delicious . The oil-poached crispy free range chicken was also very good. Fairly good value too. Only slight disappointment was the fried beef and water spinach with fermented bean curd. The gravy was a bit too watery.\n\n                          Five dishes including the pigeon was only $60 including taxes! If 'Kwong' is looking for a 'value for money' place with tons of more expensive optional fresh seafood, this is good candidate!\n\n                          1. re: Charles Yu\n\n                            Where are Sun Star and Tanchikee located? Thanks.\n\n                            1. re: caitlink\n\n                              Sun Star is at 636 Finch Ave.,E, between Bayview and Leaslie\n                              Tanchikee is at NE corner of Chalmers and Hwy7\n\n                            2. re: Charles Yu\n\n                              One more thing I would like to add about Sun Star is the huge selection of fresh seafood that were listed on the black board. I'm not sure whether everything is available but its mighty impressive!\n\n                              1. re: Charles Yu\n\n                                Back to Sun Star... for those of you that love fatty pork (and my wife is killing me, ordering it almost every other meal we eat out), they have a version that's thinly sliced (about 1/2 cm) and cooked in a shrimp sauce. Very flavourful (in fact, I having some as left overs now as I type this report). It's not the usually soft mushy fat that other chinese fatty pork dishes serve (I usually spit out the fat after a few bites). This one was a slight bit chewy in texture.\n\n                                The other dish that was gobbled up quick was their small deep fried white fish, beautifully crisp and well seasoned.\n\n                                Hey Charles, I did take my new born there too... the place is nice and loud, so most people didn't notice her crying at all. :)\n\n                          2. re: Charles Yu\n\n                            I don't find Fantasy Eatery expensive. I think it's very fair pricing. I'm just saying that I feel I get more for my buck at Maple Yip. I guess the whole discussion on Maple Yip is off topic anyways since the OP seems to be looking for great food, regardless of price.\n\n                            I guess I'm just reacting to the posts saying that Maple Yip was a waste of a meal (which it would be if money is no object), and to the one that says that other places have better value (I'm sure there are some, but I can't imagine there are a LOT because the price performace is pretty darn good at Maple Yip).\n\n                            Anyways, in case I wasn't clear, my bottom line is:\n                            Fantasy Eatery is great, and it's better than Maple Yip, but I find it to be SLIGHTLY less cost effective.\n\n                            1. re: Charles Yu\n\n                              Hi Charles,\n                              Found your Authentic Chinese uptown recommendations here and wondered if you could recommend some of your downtown favorites (or a recent thread).\n\n                              1. re: PoppiYYZ\n\n                                Sorry to say, but, apart from Lai Wah Heen down town and Lai Toh Heen mid-town, IMO there is NO restaurant downtown ( especially Cantonese ones ) that comes remotely close to the good ones in Scarborough, Markham, Thornhill or Richmond Hill.\n                                Swatow is OK but for stirred fry or soup noodles and other quick 'one plate meal' dishes\n\n                                Lai Wah Heen\n                                108 Chestnut St, Toronto, ON M5G 1R3, CA\n\n                                Lai Toh Heen\n                                692 Mt Pleasant Rd, Toronto, ON M4S, CA\n\n                                309 Spadina Ave, Toronto, ON M5T2E6, CA\n\n                                1. re: Charles Yu\n\n                                  This is the same story in most every North American Chinese community--the good stuff has migrated to the suburbs, the center city pales by comparison. That's just the way it is.\n\n                                  1. re: Charles Yu\n\n                                    FYI, a new Casa \"chain\" restaurant is opening downtown, at Bay and Irwin, where 5th Elementt used to be. Of course how good it will be remains to be seen. Looks like it's nearing completion.\n\n                                    5th Elementt\n                                    1033 Bay Street, Toronto, ON M5S 3A5, CA\n\n                                    1. re: Teep\n\n                                      A correction, the new restaurant is Crown Princess - a sister restaurant to Crown Prince, and not in the Casa family. The confusion came from the fact that its Chinese name has 3 out of 4 characters the same as Casa Victoria. There is a disclaimer on the Casa sites that basically says that their chain only consists of C. Victoria and C. Imperial.\n\n                                      Some reviews of Crown Princess are here\n\n                                      Crown Prince\n                                      3600 Victoria Park Ave, North York, ON M2H 3B2, CA\n\n                                      1. re: Teep\n\n                                        Crown Princess - 3 Blocks South of Bloor on Bay\n\n                                        Crown Princess\n                                        1033 Bay Street, Toronto, ON M5S 3A5, CA\n\n                                        1. re: Teep\n\n                                          I think this is referring to my reviews. I've been to Crown Princess a few times since they opened (working on my VIP discount status!). It's very good compared to other options downtown, but that's because the other options aren't very good. There's a big gap between Lai Wah Heen and everything else ... I normally just go to Bright Pearl for cheaper dim sum with big groups, or LWH for a special occasion.\n\n                                          I don't think Crown Princess is as good as options on the Hwy 7 strip, in terms of both quality and price, *yet*. From their menu and from brief conversations with the staff, I get the impression that they want to work on the high end, more innovative market that Lai Wah Heen targets (i.e. bolder flavour and texture contrasts, more varied ingredients), but it's probably fair to give them a few weeks before passing judgement. This location does not have a history of successful establishments.\n\n                                          As an amusing aside, the local Chinese store owners are really, really excited. Perhaps borderline bubbly.\n\n                                          1. re: Underdog Rally\n\n                                            IMHO, there are no more 'Great' Chinese restaurants on the Hwy 7 strip anymore! If I have to settle for one, I'll choose 'Judy's Cuisine'.for Cantonese and 'Northern Dumpling Kitchen for Northern cuisine. Both inside Time Square complex. Others are pretty mediocre, run of the mill, often 'over-rated' establishments.\n\n                                              1. re: Chandavkl\n\n                                                All scattered!\n                                                Brilliant in Markham, Maple Yip in Scarborough, Emperor in Richmond Hill, LTH in midtown, LWH in downtown....etc. If you don't mind settling on just one specialty - Giant Lobster 4 ways, then Hwy 7 do have one - O'Mei\n\n                                                1. re: Charles Yu\n\n                                                  Thanks, Charles. Getting my list ready for my next visit to Toronto. Had a great meal a few months ago at Lai Wah Heen and agree that Judy Cuisine and Northern Dumpling are excellent. Maple Yip is a puzzle. Went there a couple of years ago based on board recommendations and ordered the set dinner, which had been a successful tactic at Casa Imperial. It was very disappointing--no better than what you can get in Los Angeles Chinatown. (By point of reference, food quality in LA Chinatown is comparable to Toronto Chinatown.) Indeed, Mrs. Chandavkl scolded me for wasting one of our three Toronto dinners there. Even if it is in fact superior, the boss will never let me set foot there again!\n\n                                                  Lai Wah Heen\n                                                  108 Chestnut St, Toronto, ON M5G 1R3, CA\n\n                                                  Casa Imperial\n                                                  4125 Steeles Ave E, Scarborough, ON M1W 3T4, CA\n\n                                                  Judy Cuisine\n                                                  550 7 Hwy E, Richmond Hill, ON L4B3Z4, CA\n\n                                                  1. re: Chandavkl\n\n                                                    If you are from LA, I would suggest that you make a trip to Hwy 7 O'Mei and give their Giant Lobster 4 ways a try. Nothing like that in the US, be it LA, SF, Seattle or NYC!!\n                                                    BTW, it is no longer relevant to compare Chinese food in 'Chinatown' with each other since nowadays, all great establishments have all moved to the outskirts. Toronto and Vancouver are prime examples. Food in China town are usually 'outdated' and mediocre.\n\n                                                    1. re: Charles Yu\n\n                                                      Hi Charles!\n                                                      I respect your views a lot and always look forward to your reviews, alerts and opinions. Your photos are always a highlight of scouring these boards! But as a \"Low \"Wah Kiu\" Chinese, most of my extended family and I prefer an old fashoined Chinese family meal (soup de jour or \"Lai Tong\", several dishes comprising various meats, seafoods, vegetables, tofu and steamed rice. An occasional meal or banquet in a \"white linen\" suburban restaurant can indeed be a treat. But for us, the old fashioned meal is a staple- hearty, satisfying, filled with \"wok hay\" and reasonably priced. It has always been our experience in Toronto's Chinatown (I'm 60 years old) that different restaurants have different special dishes, and we tend to go to restaurants when we are in the mood for particular dishes. Overall, the quality might not stack up to some good suburban spots, but the satisying of cravings for certain dishes is enough for us to make the trip to certain Chinatown restaurants. Having said that, i look forward to your highly informative postings on these boards.\n\n                                        2. re: Charles Yu\n\n                                          Thanks Charles,\n\n                                          I don't mind traveling for a good meal.

Went there once on a weeknight. Not bad but the place was mostly empty. Many set dinners. Worth a try.\n\n                                          1. re: syoung\n\n                                            Regal Chinese Cuisine @ Finch/McCowan\n\n                                            Regal Chinese Cuisine\n                                            1571 Sandhurst Circle, Unit 107, Scarborough, ON M1V 1V2, CA\n\n                          3. re: BokChoi\n\n                            Wow, what a detailed reply. I will print this out to read on my lunch hour. Thank you so much.\n\n                            Well, there is a \"reason\" why I choose cleaner restaurants having had many ailments which are against policy to post here. I have a sensitive stomach and weak immune system, so I choose cleaner establishments. Not quite possible in eating outside, I should be the first to know, but I try not to put my health at risk when eating at places where I've come home and not felt well.\n\n                            I absolutely love your pics and share a passion for photography with you! I've been known to carry my bulky camera with me when eating out, to share with friends and relatives who absolutely love food!\n\n                            P.S. I've tried Ruby Restaurant and Spring Villa many times before.\n\n                            1. re: red dragon\n\n                              Thanks for the compliments, red_dragon!\n\n                              Have you found any restaurants that are along the same lines as Ruby for dinner? I'm on the lookout because I find many other restaurants are a bit salty and overflavoured for my tastes. I tend to like more bland foods (cantonese \"tsing\" phonetic translation). In Hong Kong, I didn't seem to have a problem finding things that suited my tastes, but here, I tend only to stick to a few tried,tested and true venues. I do not enjoy heavy sauces, or usage or MSG or cornstarch to thicken sauces - any recs?\n\n                              The restaurants I've suggested, though not very pretty, they seem to be very clean. But you never know unless you inspect their kitchens! (of which I only had the opportunity to view Grand's immaculately kept kitchens in the Doubletree - as to be expected!) I have never had a problem at those restos and I have been going for over 8 years now...\n\n                              Lotus is a safe clean choice. They are actually one of the nicer, cleaner Chinese restaurants I've been to. Here are some more pics that I posted today\n                              Seaweed Roll: http://www.flickr.com/photos/28531775...\n                              Stuffed Tofu: http://www.flickr.com/photos/28531775...\n                              Pak Choi Dumpling: http://www.flickr.com/photos/28531775...\n                              Crystal bun: http://www.flickr.com/photos/28531775...\n                              Silver thread loaf: http://www.flickr.com/photos/28531775...\n\n\n                              1. re: BokChoi\n\n                                Hi Bokchoi, haven't found or tried a Chinese Restaurant yet, but I will many choices, thanks to you. As for Lai Wah Heen, a bit out of our price range and it's downtown. I've tried Casa Imperial, but only for dimsum, pricey, but good. Think I'll give Ruby a try, have only been there for dimsum, but like you said, it's better for dinner. Some restaurants are like that. Our favorite dimsum place is Dragon Dynasty on Brimley/Huntingwood, but we didn't like their dinners. Thanks again for the suggestions and all those photos! Making me hungry, it's 8:30am and I'm at work, but wishing I could have some of those delicous foods that you took pictures of!!\n\n                                1. re: red dragon\n\n                                  BokChoi, red dragon: Your posts sound like you both have quite a bit of experience with the N. Scarborough area. Interested in your opinions about the two Sam Woo's on Bamburgh and the Elegantview at McNichol & Vic Park. I've enjoyed the dim sum at Elegantview and prefer the Sam Woo BBQ at supper over Sam Woo Seafood as it's less pretentious, but I find all 3 places good stand-by's.\n\n                                  1. re: T Long\n\n                                    Thanks Red Dragon - hope you like the food recs. Dragon Dynasty is actually the sister restaurant of the other restaurant I recommended \u2013 Grand Chinese Restaurant. The chain has 3 related restos - one low end (Big Mouth Kee at Hwy7), one mid range (Dragon Dynasty), and finally Grand (the high end located near the airport). I don\u2019t really have dim sum at any other location besides Grand, except when I feel like vegetarian \u2013 and that is when I head over to Lotus Pond.\n\n                                    T_Long, I would have to say that I have not given Sam Woo that many opportunities to fully be able to judge them. Nor have I ever tried Elegant View to be honest. I would have to say from my experiences at Sam Woo for dim sum that I have been very disappointed and find their ingredients a bit lacking and the techniques used a bit more rudimentary than what I am accustomed to. But I know that it is very popular and I am sure for good reason. I am just not a fan, that is all. Of course, I am comparing this to higher end (read: more expensive) dim sum, so I am sure that\u2019s not level playing ground either. I just find that I am willing to pay more to get that extra bit of excitement when I dine. Others may not find it justifiable. How do you find their dinner? Would you consider Elegant View to be very light in flavour and use only the freshest ingredients? I would be interested to try it if it were. I am always on the lookout for a new standby favourite. My dining companions are often not as adventurous, so it may take some convincing\u2026 any tips on dishes to try?\n                                    What's good to try at O'Mei, Charles_Yu? Some acquaintances tried it on an earlier occasion and told me to avoid it \u2013 but maybe they just sampled some bad dishes?\n\n                                    1. re: BokChoi\n\n                                      BokChoi: I consider Sam Woo Seafood a decent place overall, maybe mid-range compared to say Grand, Casa or the Lai Wah's at the higher end. For me Lai Wah Heen is the best and I will spend the extra dough from time to time to go there for the dim sum, but I shy away from the other high end places for food only considerations because the cost-enjoyment factor is not there for me...so for most dim sum cravings, I will go to the mid-range places. That said, I prefer the dim sum at Elegantview slightly over Sam Woo Seafood. Another \"mid-range\" place that I liked recently was at the Legend at Glen Cameron in Thornhill...very basic, but well executed.\n\n                                    2. re: T Long\n\n                                      Hi T_Long,\n\n                                      I wouldn't say I'm a food expert though, just a food lover! I've lived in Scarborough/Toronto for over 20 years and have tried so many places. We eat out alot.\n\n                                      As for Sam Woo (at Bamburgh Circle), it used to be a favorite of my parents and grandparents, and we ordered BBQ meats from there all the time for our get togethers. In my opinion, the place went downhill and is not that clean, haven't been back in ages. It might have changed hands or changed in general since then.\n\n                                      I think I've only been to Elegantview once, and it was awhile ago, so sorry I can't comment.\n\n                                      Everyone's tastes and preferences are so different though, so I try to respect that. I would certainly think Bokchoi has had many more experiences and her/his (I don't know Bokchoi) pictures are amazing!\n\n                                      The other problem is knowing restaurant's names!! People refer me to them, saying it's on this corner and that corner, but what's the name???? LOL. And I don't want the Chinese name, I can't read Chinese!!\n\n                                      Well for now, our favorite dimsum place remains Dragon Dynasty and I'll be trying some other places for \"dinner\" so I'll be sure to post. You'll find a ton of reviews here!\n\n                                      We were going to Asian Legen for a long while and even had the VIP card, but that went downhill, so we started going to another Shanghainese place behind First Markham Place. Sorry, name fails me right now. I'll try to remember and post back here. Well, that was going great, and then they must have changed cooks or owners, food was going downhill as well as portions.\n\n                                      Edited to add: Restaurant is called Ala Kitchen, it was great when it opened, but again, in our opinion, went downhill. We were sad to see that happen as we were going once a week, haven't been there in months.\n\n                                      I tried Asian Station (is that the name) in the plaza beside Pacific Mall, geesh, I'm not doing well with names today. It was ok, more on a referral from a teenager, so our tastes were not the same.\n                                      Edited to add: I think it's called Market Village? Geesh, I live nearby and can't remember the name - a sign of aging :(\n\n                                      Used to go to Congee Wong/Queen a LOT, and now we go to Congee Star, a lot farther for us but one one the co-owners, Sam, is great! Speaks perfect English and when I tell him \"less oil, less salt,\" I get exactly that!\n\n                                      Hmmm, what else can I recommend??? I'm at work, so I'll give it some thought and keep posting.\n\n                                      Happy Eats in the meantime!\n\n                                      1. re: red dragon\n\n                                        Thanks for the compliment, once again, red_dragon. T_long, I will give those places a try - do you have any fave dishes that you can recommend to me? That way I make sure I order the best dishes, as I find many places have 'specialties' that elevate them above the masses.\n\n                                        I must try Lai Wah Heen again. It's been quite a few months since I've last dined there. It's hard to work into my schedule since I only have time for dim sum once a week, and that is usually taken up by Grand! LOL. But I will admit that Grand has slightly dimished from their glory when I first started dining there over a year ago. The chef told me that other restaurants are poaching his staff (the head chef at Casa trained under the Grand head chef for a few months before being lured away). Hopefully they will pick it up again soon!\n\n                                        1. re: red dragon\n\n                                          Hi Red Dragon: about Sam Woo BBQ....not sure if its changed that much over the years, but my sense is that it has been pretty consistent over a long period of time, like well over 20 years. In its early days it stood out because there was not much competition for that quality of food, but with time that has changed. As for cleanliness, I would put it down as mid-range...a description which fits most of the better mid-range Chinese restos...Btw, I judge cleanliness mainly from the state of the washrooms.\n\n                                          1. re: T Long\n\n                                            I shouldn't really give a fair review on Sam Woo since I have not been there in perhaps 15 years or so, but I do recall fondly, it being a family favorite.\n\n                                            LOL, that's one of the things I look for as well, clean washrooms! I'm apalled when I see the liquid soap dispensers empty!!! I've seen servers use the same washrooms - yikes! Some people might comment that what you don't see won't hurt you, or you'd never know what goes on in the kitchens (actually I do), but with my sensitive stomach, I do try to be more careful.\n\n                                            Here's something funny to share with you. When we try a new place and after I feel ok the next day, my husband says, \"ok, that's a keeper.\" LOL\n\n                                2. re: BokChoi\n\n                                  I was notified that one of my links from above was not functional.\n                                  Here is the Ruby Lotus Fried Rice Takout:\n\n                                  So far, my favourite fried rice in T.O.

Some of the food was borderline pathetic. We had a whole roast suckling pig whose skin was not only 'not crispy' but it was actually chewy and tough!! Almost all the seafood dishes ( prawns, scallops, lobsters ) have sauces/gravy that are overly starchy! Al in all a bad Chinese food experience!\n                                      FYI, Dragon Dynasty, a block down on Brimley has much better tasting food! Though a touch more expensive.\n\n                                      1. re: Charles Yu\n\n                                        Hello Charles Yu!\n                                        I am sorry to hear that you did not have a good experience there. To be honest, I do not frequently have their banquet meals there as I usually only go with a smaller group <5. But of the times I have gone there for large group banquets (weddings, large birthday parties, social functions) they were definitely sub-par to their usual performance. I usually order off their regular a la carte Chinese menu and it has never really let me down (except one time - don't go on a Thursday, they mentioned the chef does not work that day and that was the one time I did not have a good meal there). Every restaurant has some solid dishes. Here are some recommendations that you can hopefully try next time if you ever return:\n\n                                        - deep fried fillet of sole with crispy bone + pan fried yu kuw (fish pieces) with snow peas (the skin and bones a crisply fried and the fish pieces are juicy. The snow peas are crunchy and there is no starchy gravy anywhere to be seen)\n                                        - snow pea leaves with ling jee goo mushrooms or jun jee goo (they are excellent in their braised veggie/mushroom dishes) with minimal sauce\n                                        - doong gwa joong (winter melon soup). Excellent soup with a light and sweet broth that is only $18 if you go in a group over 5 ( I hardly get to order this because I usually go in a small group)\n                                        - sew gai (roast chicken) or their yow gai (soya chicken)\n                                        - finally their lotus leaf steamed fried rice (fried rice that is baked in a lotus leaf wrap upon completion). Excellent rice dish. Best in TO that I have found.\n\n                                        I have been to Dragon Dynasty and I did not enjoy it the few times I have been there as much as Ruby. But each restaurant is entitled to have off days. Dragon Dynasty is one of the better ones in the area IMO. I found of a couple of days that they were exceptionally salty though, but it could have been an accident on their part. It is one of my more frequented restaurants (top 5 in the area), though I would not think of it as one of my favourites.\n\n                                        I am shocked that the suckling pig was off - as their bbq is usually spot on. Their skin is normally very crispy and very little fat. Each day their bbq is done fresh. I have never had a 'chewy' nor tough suckling pig - but I do not order it often. I usually only have it on the 'ping poon' dish with the mixed meats.\n\n                                        Another note that I should have warned you about - their seafood is not the strongest. On my photo site I have noted that their calamari and shrimps and scallops are sub-par, but did not transfer that info to CH. Apologies. As well, I tend to avoid seafood dishes at restaurants because I find most Chinese restaurants use frozen seafood, unless it is whole fresh prawns or fish. As well, a member of my party has cholesterol problems, hence we do not order those dishes (shrimp/lobster) as well so I could not cover that angle.\n\n                                    2. Interesting no body mentioned about O'Mei on Hwy#7 so far. One doesn't have to order the Lobster. Rest of the menu is pretty good too.\n\n                                      12 Replies\n                                      1. re: Charles Yu\n\n                                        Charles, I've had referals from many of my Caucasion co-workers? I thought the food was more Canadian Chinese (S&S Pork, Cantonese Chow Mein, etc), or do they have more authentic offerings?\n\n                                        I see it all the time when I drive by ... Like BokChoi, I've had advice to avoid it as well? Perhaps it needs to be given a chance ....\n\n                                        1. re: red dragon\n\n                                          I tried OMei dim sum on Hwy 7 twice based on charles recommendation. I found it to be a good value for the quality of ingredients and flavours. Mind you, we didn't try anything too fancy like you would get at either of the Casa's, LWH or the Grand, but it's good for \"solid' quality dim sum.\n\n                                          I used to go to Sam Woo at Bamburgh for dim sum quite bit as well, but that was before we discovered all the other higher end places. Now we don't even bother, but I'm sure it's busy simply because of all the local patrons living in the area (all those condo's). Don't get it mixed up with the other Sam Woo on the opposite end of the same shopping plaza, which sells BBQ meats and more simple Cantonese fare.\n\n                                          Elegant view we've also gone a few times over the past few months. The first 2 times we enjoyed it, especially during the off peak hours and the good discounts (going back again to get our free bag of rice). But lately I've been getting bored with their selections, maybe I just need more variety.\n\n                                          I still have to make it out to The Grand and Casa Victoria one of these days since I've yet to try them.\n\n                                          1. re: red dragon\n\n                                            Hwy7 O'Mei has a whole menu plus 'specials of the day' that are as authentic as any dishes you'll find in Hong Kong and/or China! Your aforementioned 'Canadian Chinese dishes' are just 'side-show' to augment and try to satisfy 'uneducated/caucasian palates\n\n                                            BTW, two other 'not yet mentioned' worthwhile' restaurants to consider are 'Dragon Boat Cuisine' on East Beaver Creek Road and Legend in Thornhill, corner of Glen Cameron and Yonge. Very good food.\n\n                                            1. re: Charles Yu\n\n                                              You mentioned above that not just the lobster is good at O'Mei. What specials would you recommend or have you enjoyed there? I'm headed that way this weekend.\n\n                                              btw, your \"uneducated/caucasian\" comment...you should be more careful with your wording.\n\n                                              1. re: grandgourmand\n\n                                                Here are two threads out of many which have extensive coverage on Omei for you to reference, they are not most recent, but the points there are still valid :\n\n\n\n                                                I just visit Omei for their 4-way Giant Lobster recently and it is still as good as before.\n\n                                                1. re: skylineR33\n\n                                                  Thanks, skyline.\n\n                                                  Hey, you had mentioned authentic sichuan (e.g. Hot Spicy Spicy) in another thread...what should I order? That's another destination in the near future.\n\n                                                  1. re: grandgourmand\n\n                                                    I would recommend Chongqing Spicy Deep Fried Chicken (\u91cd\u6176\u8fa3\u5b50\u96de), sliced pork in garlic sauce (\u849c\u6ce5\u767d\u8089), Shu zhu spicy sauce fish/beef (\u6c34\u716e\u9b5a/\u725b), Tea smoke duck (\u6a1f\u8336\u9d28), Ma Paul Tofu. Some of the dishes are pretty spicy. Hope you find them ok !\n\n                                                2. re: grandgourmand\n\n                                                  Hello Grandgourmand. Many thanks for your cautionary comment. I'll be more careful! Absolutely no intention to offend anyone! Thousand apologies!\n                                                  I guess I'm just trying to convey the fact that the 'main authentic' menu has indeed a lot of dishes that uses 'pungent' ingredients such as salted fish, preserved meats and vegetables, fermented bean curd and shrimp paste etc, To the uninitiated, these might actually smell and taste a bit offensive. ( In fact, in last weekend's Toronto star, there was an article written by one their travelling correspondent who warned visitors to the Beijing Olympics to 'specially AVOID' delicacies like Stinky Tofu. This is one-sided reporting IMO. For, to some of us Orientals who had been exposed to these sensation, we find the smell adictive and the taste and texture of the morsels simply out of this world. But, for first-timers the sensation could be unfamiliar. Not unlike Blue Cheese and/or anchovies. ). Anyways, for what ever reason, almost all authentic Chinese restaurants do offer a special ' westernize chinese food' section for those who are less adventurous.\n                                                  Now, back to O'Mei's signature dishes. I personally like their version of the crispy free range chicken. If available, I find their Geoduck sashimi, at $68 a bargain, since normally it costs $98. Just love the sweet taste and crisy/chewy texture of the clam. Some of their casual 'home-cook' dishes like Steamed minced pork pattie with diced Chinese mushroom,water chestnut and dried cuttlefish is very tasty. The addition of some minced dry shrimps into the minced pork/preserved olives mixture raises the normally ordinary fried string beans dish to another level. Even something ordinary like stirred fry beef with Chinese brocolli was very well executed.\n                                                  A word of caution! Do check the market price of 'Special of the day recommendation' by the owner/wait staff to avoid potential shock when the bill comes ( including yje giant lobster )\n\n                                                  1. re: Charles Yu\n\n                                                    No worries.\n\n                                                    Thanks for the advice. How many people does Geoduck sashimi feed? I recognize it's one dish, but for sharing purposes, I'm curious.\n\n                                                    1. re: grandgourmand\n\n                                                      I've eaten the Geoduck dish when dining with a party of five. Last time, about a month ago, we were a party of ten and there were more than enough slices to go around for seconds and thirds. The presentation is one big platter with the sliced morsels spread over a huge ice-dome.\n\n                                                      1. re: Charles Yu\n\n                                                        Hi Charles, I once ordered the Geoduck 3-ways, and it is ~$100 for 3.5 lbs. Even the guy there said it is top quality and show us the live geoduck before cutting it, I still found it a bit expensive, so I did not order it again. Is the $68 a set price for a plate, and it does not go by weight ?\n\n                                                        Hey grandgourmand, here is a picture of the geoduck (for the sashimi and the hot pot course), it gives you a idea of what it's like.\n\n                                                        1. re: skylineR33\n\n                                                          I was told by Ringo the owner that for this week, they have received a special large quantity consignment of Grade A clams. As such, they can offer each of them at a special $68 fix price to their customers. It'll be one way only, either hot-pot or sashimi style.\n\n                                          2. From my other post a few days ago regarding Grands Chinese Cuisine. Also, I found some of the dinner set at their sister restaurant Dragon Dynasty is exactly same as Grand but with a cheaper price. Or course, the money goes to the service at Grand I guess ...\n\n                                            Grand's dinner is poor with some dishes average at best. Had one of their most expensive dinner set a few months ago which features \"One Head\" abalone. But found out that it is a ripped off as it is no way the size of even a \"three head\". It is cooked very rough with not enough time, the taste of the broth is not infused into the abalone at all, leaving it like eating rubber. The other dishes are average at best. The last course fried rice is some of the worst fried rice I have ever eaten, it is as dried as eating a piece of boiled chicken breast, I think they over burnt it.\n\n                                            After that we had another 10 courses dinner in there which is also very disappointed, especially with the steamed sea bass which is over cooked to the point that the texture of the fish is even worst than frozen fish.\n\n                                            The decor of it is not comfortable with its low ceiling and no window.\n\n                                            Wedding in there is a no-no with a hugh problem in leaving the parking lot afterward, without even mentioning the food. How do I know ? I have been invited to a wedding in there before, took me 20 mins to get out of the parking lot.\n\n                                            Dim Sum at Grand is still good, but not to the standard of Lai Wah Heen IMO, but cheaper.\n\n\n                                            ElegantView is a good choice for casual dinner. Omei is a great restaurant for seafood.\n\n                                            15 Replies\n                                            1. re: skylineR33\n\n                                              Do not worry skylineR33 - I am not recommending their dinners. But thank you for clarifying that, just in case some unsuspecting chowhounder heads out that way for dinner...\n\n                                              1. re: BokChoi\n\n                                                I still think best authentic cantonese dinner would be Casa Imperial. Excellent service and the lobster, and steamed fish came out perfectly cooked. My parents are retired restauranteurs and even they were impressed.\n                                                I tried Maple Yip last month based on all the reviews.

SkylineR33, can you tell me if Elegant View is the one on the corner of McNicol and VicPark? I've been there a long time ago for dimsum, but not for dinner? What would be some dishes to try?\n\n                                                I could try and look back for your info, but again, this freezing and spinning issue is driving me crazy.\n\n\n                                                1. re: red dragon\n\n                                                  I went for dinner at Elegant View last night (I'm like you red dragon, I only tried dim sum before), had the baby sea cucumbers with veggie (my first time eating it - nice and slightly chewy, nice light sauce), the deep fried mango chicken (very westernized dish, too sweet for my liking), grouper pieces with sour veggie and clear flat noodle, and a fried rice with scallops, egg and asparagus. They also give free soup and dessert (red bean). Overall pretty good, a bit pricier but you do get bigger portions and better ingredients. Total bill after taxes was $61. They have some 2.88 lobster special but we didn't try it.\n\n                                                  1. re: Royaljelly\n\n                                                    Thanks for your review and feedback! Glad you enjoyed it. I've never tried sea cucumber before. I've also never tried beef tendons until about a year ago, when someone told me it was good for joint pain. Depending on how it's made, it was very delicious. I liked the way they made it at dimsum (Dragon Dynasty) - couldn't get enough of it, until I got sick of eating it.\n\n                                                    I will certainly keep Elegant View in mind.\n\n                                                    Have a good weekend!\n\n                                                  2. re: red dragon\n\n                                                    Yes, that's the one which has a red color tone. Their price is not cheap when compare to others like Fantasy Eatery and Tanchikee.\n\n                                                    ElegantView's sweet and sour pork is good. A good sweet and sour pork is not an easy dish to make, the one at ElegrantView is quite good. The mushroom wok-fried beef is also a very good dish in there with good wok-hay. Strongly recommended. They also have a daily seafood list, but watch out some of those fish items in the list is not in the \"live\" form, don't order those, make sure you only order 'live' seafood from there if you want to eat seafood there. Their steamed \"live\" scallop with either the black bean sauce or garlic is very nicely done if they have it on the daily \"seafood\" list. I find it better than the one at Maple Yip.\n\n                                                    Steamed fish, lobster (not the $2.88 deal) is so-so. They have the 8.88/lb weekday lobster deal, but quality cannot be compared to places like Omei. I have tried the $2.88 lobster, actually it is good with such a pricing, you will have a few bite of lobster meat !\n\n                                                    1. re: skylineR33\n\n                                                      HI SkylineR33 - I absolutely love S&S pork, one of my standard items when I go to a Cantonese style restaurant. You're right, I haven't tried too many places that can \"get it right.\" I think the type of pork is important. I've had it at places where the pork tastes like a cheap cut, awful tasting. Other times, there is too much fat, or it's too sweet, etc. Glad to hear this dish is good at Elegant View. I'm very particular about my seafood, with Chinese restaurants, never know where the fish is coming from and how fresh it is. Same with lobster - most times it's water logged.\n\n                                                      So, only order seafood that is on display in the aquariums right?\n\n                                                      Thanks for your feedback!\n\n                                                      1. re: skylineR33\n\n                                                        Hi skyline, how did they serve their $2.88 lobster? I didn't ask for details at the time. The grouper \"pieces\" in noodle was not bad in terms of freshness (we were wondering if it was live or previously frozen). At least I didn't notice any of the fishiness that I get at some chinese restos.\n\n                                                        I always bring my 2.5 yr old son to look at every chinese resto's fish tanks (he demands it), and I recall that ElegantView did have a pretty good stock of choices (some lobster as massive as the ones I saw at Omei).\n\n                                                        Reading about sweet n sour pork reminds me of how my my parents used to request the sauce be put \"on the side\", just to maintain the crunchiness at the end of the meal. That's what I had to deal with growing up with both parents that were restaurant cooks.\n\n                                                        1. re: Royaljelly\n\n                                                          Hi red dragon,\n                                                          The seafood tank in Elegant View is a bit congest, I think they need a bigger one, haha. Variety is good like what Royaljelly said. It just that they have quite a good selection of seafood and they mix the frozen one with the 'live' one in the daily seafood list which maybe confusing for some people so I just point it out ...\n\n                                                          Hi Royaljelly,\n                                                          Yes, the lobster is massive at ElegrantView, but they can only do it one way, for multiple way, you will have to pay more \"production fee\". The $2.88 lobster is for half of a small lobster, which can be done in different way, like with maggie sauce, ginger and onion...they will ask you how you want it done. I think for a ingradient in noodle, the freshness of the grouper pieces are fine. But in some of their specific fish/seafood only dishes, they use \"frozen\" which they do it pretty bad, it completely shows the \"frozen\" taste of the fish/seafood.\n\n                                                          1. re: Royaljelly\n\n                                                            I had S&S pork from Elegantview for take-out today. They asked if I wanted the sauce on the side....saying many customers request this....\n\n                                                          2. re: skylineR33\n\n                                                            Hey skylineR33, have you been to tan chi kee lately? Has things changed?\n\n                                                            It used to be one of our regular eats but earlier this year, we went there to find the usual family owners gone and they only had two waitresses serving the floor. Two! Service was obviously poor and slow but we felt so bad for the two girls. We've been scared to go back since.\n\n                                                            1. re: tksh\n\n                                                              My last time to Tanchikee is in June. Food is still as good as before But yes, there are only 2 to 3 waitresses serving and service is very slow, we also feel bad for the waitresses. But I think the low price and quality of food worths going back.\n\n                                                              1. re: skylineR33\n\n                                                                The girls there are actually pretty nice (especially to our son) when it's more quiet (we usually go at odd hours). I really like their sweet n' sour pork chop (sometimes served w/ strawberrries), good balance of vinegar and more darker red sauce than the usual orange sauce like other canto resto's.\n\n                                                                1. re: Royaljelly\n\n                                                                  S&S Pork with strawberries? That's very unusual. What other items have you had at Tanchikee?\n\n                                                                  1. re: red dragon\n\n                                                                    It's been a few months since I've moved south of 401, so I haven't been back since probably march or so. But dishes I recall having a few times were the ox tail hot pot, a fried rice that was served in a large ?bamboo shoot like vessel (taste was ok). The seafood dishes were just so so.\n\n                                                      2. Ugh. On a recommendation I read earlier on a post, I tried Le Chine up at Hwy 7 and East Beaver Creek last Sunday. All I can say is - what a disappointment. Not impressed - and for $80 for two ppl, one would expect amazing Chinese food (since I can often have something great at a fraction of that price. Unfair, I know, to be willing to pay less for great Chinese food, but I judge based on market rate). Granted I had the shark's fin soup meal, which upped the ante - the taste was way off IMO and was bland and unseasoned (and I usually prefer bland. Now THAT is shocking.), except the sharkfin soup, which tasted a lot like \"street style\" shark's fin soup (heavy beef base) with generous amounts of shark's fin, but was exceptionally salty. Good note was that the ingredients were fresh....? And they never skimped out on the more expensive ingredients...?\n\n                                                        9 Replies\n                                                        1. re: BokChoi\n\n                                                          Yes, agree that food at La Chine is strong flavour and salty. But it is quite good on some of them.\n\n                                                          However, do you mean the shark fin broth is beef base ?? I have never seen or heard shark fin uses beef broth, whether it is in Hong Kong, mainland China or North America, probably you mean chicken and pork base broth ? I can't imgine shark fin and beef goes together.\n\n                                                          I also had shark fin soup at La Chine before but it is not the \"street style\" that I had.\n\n                                                          1. re: skylineR33\n\n                                                            I was actually quite shocked that they used such a strong base as well. I would have preferred a light chicken-based broth, or a filtered mixture with a touch of pork \u2013 but this one was definitely heavy and had a beef-y flavour. It reminded me of street-style shark\u2019s fin (at Dragon Dynasty) except instead of the vermicelli, they had giant chunks of overly-braised shark\u2019s fin. The shark\u2019s fin quantity was impressive, but it was over-braised for my taste. It ended up being mushy, instead of having the firm bite that I like. It\u2019s really about the texture when it comes to shark\u2019s fin for me, because honestly, I do not think shark\u2019s fin itself has much in the way of flavour. I was shocked also to see strands of actual meat (pork) in my broth \u2013 like they forgot to put it through a fine sieve and just scooped it up from the bottom of a giant stock pot that had been sitting over a flame for 10+ hrs. There were also giant globules of fat on the surface. Not very classy, IMO. Should not a high class restaurant skim the top of the soup before serving it? At least remove enough so that it does not look like I am consuming an oil slick. The grouper was quite nice \u2013 large, fresh chunks of fish. The veggie accompaniment (sugar snap peas) were also well done and sweet. But I was not impressed with their lack of seasoning and usage of herbs. Maybe it was just an \"off\" day?\n\n                                                            1. re: BokChoi\n\n                                                              There are different kind of shark fin dishes, like double broiled or braised ... strong broth base (not salty) for shark fin is normal. Still puzzle by the beefy flavour that you had, did you mix up with the taste of Jin Wah Ham ? Also, it is normal to have pork in the broth if those are Jin Wah ham. What colour is the pork ?\n\n                                                              Where is your favourite place for shark fin in Toronto or HK ?\n\n                                                              1. re: skylineR33\n\n                                                                The soup base was extremely salty in this case. I am not sure which version you had, or if they had changed the recipe since, but the version I had was heavy, dark, oily and had pork meat at the bottom of the bowl. The soup was also cloudy and reminiscent of an overboiled beef/pork broth. The pork was not any ham I had ever seen (ie there was no way I could confuse the meat with ham) - the pork was the same type that I usually find in my \"on the house\" soup at Fantasy. I don't mind consuming pork bits in my \"on the house\" soup, but I do mind it a bit when it is combined with an oil-slick-of-a-soup for $20~30 a bowl. Sorry for berating this dish, I am merely trying to emphasize my displeasure. It is certainly not the WORST shark's fin soup I have ever had.\n\n                                                                Here is a photo of the soup: http://www.flickr.com/photos/28531775...\n\n                                                                The colouring is not quite captured here, as I enlarged the aperture to allow in more light as the day was overcast. This has given the soup more of a golden glow than it originally had.\n\n                                                                I have had double braised soups in HK, but their shark's fin was still 'al dente'.\n\n                                                                Which places serve the best shark's fin soup you have ever tried?\n\n                                                                The strange thing was that the fish and the milk tofu dishes were underseasoned as opposed to the soup.\n\n                                                                1. re: BokChoi\n\n                                                                  I had shark fin soup at La Chine a couple of times. I find the quality quite good with it's pricing, but a bit too salty like what you said. From the picture, I recognise the soup base, let me tell you the soupbase does not have any beef in it, it is a chicken and pork soup base. Shark Fin soup never involves any beef, at least from any restaurant that has a little knowledge of shark fin. La chine does not provide top of the line chinese food, but I am pretty sure they are well aware of this. The strong taste that you have is from Jin Wa ham, a kind of ham that give the strong flavour to the soup base, also the meat you find in there are over-cooked Jin Wah ham as well.\n\n                                                                  There are many different kind of shark fin, some of them are not al dente, but still good, like those small one that attach to the soft membrane as a whole piece, it gives you a sticky feel on it. Al dente does not always means good, some restaurant does not cook the shark fin with enough time to let it absorb the taste of the soup base, this always leave the shark fin \"al dente\", this can also treat the patrons because it looks like there are more shark fin in the bowl as the shark fin are not as scattered into the soup.\n\n                                                                  $20 to $30 a bowl shark fin is not considered expensive at all, top one in HK charges $80 or up. LWH charges $98 for a plate of braised shark fin soup. Also FYI, some top places in HK which serves chiu chow style shark fin, which is a very strong flavour one with thick and dark colour premium broth, uses lard as a important ingradient to bring out the aroma and intensify the flavour of the dish.\n\n                                                                  \"Braised\" - \u7d05\u71d2 and \"Double boiled\" - \u71c9 are two cooking technique in chinese cuisine, there is nothing called \"Double braised\".\n\n                                                                  Try Regal 16 in Richmond Hill, it serves some of the good shark fin in GTA.\n\n                                                                  1. re: skylineR33\n\n                                                                    Sorry on the typo, I mean :\n\n                                                                    ... this can also \"cheat\" the patrons because it looks like there are more ..., not \"treat\".\n\n                                                                    1. re: skylineR33\n\n                                                                      Hello skylineR33 et al.,\n                                                                      On the subject of sharksfin. Just to inform you all that Regal16 on Spadina/16th Ave., has gone 'DOWNHILL'! Sharksfin was tough and way under cooked ( The double boiled clear broth version )! That was 2 weeks ago!

Thanks for the head's up. I had their double-boiled \"Phoenix swallowed\" shark fin a couple of time before and it was great, hope it is just a off night for them.\n\n                                                                    2. re: skylineR33\n\n                                                                      Hi skylineR33. Thanks for the tip. I will try those out. I meant double-boiled last night when I typed up my report. Slip of the tongue (err fingers). I was not complaining of the price of the soup at all - I was willing to pay (since I had ordered it), but I was shocked at the poor quality of the soup. I was pleasantly surprised when I found such large chunks of shark's fin in the soup ( I did not expect that much given the price) - but it went downhill from there once I tasted the broth.\n                                                                      I find that the most important part of the soup is the broth itself. If there is a poorly crafted broth, no amount of shark's fin can salvage it."}

I can't find evidence of there ever having been a state law requiring spousal consent for tubal ligations of vasectomies. There did used to be doctors/hospitals that required it, but that should no longer be the case, since it would be a HIPAA violation...\n\nSivazBaby \u00b7 Original Poster\nPosted 04/11/2013\nI'm in southern California... Does anybody know if i need signature?\nPosted 04/11/2013\n\nIf your doctor tells you that you need your husband's permission, I think he's in violation of the law that protects your right to confidentiality. You should not need a signature.\n\nPosted 04/11/2013\nSpouse consent is based on which state you live in. We are having our 4th too. I told DH and the OB I'm getting my tubes tied. DH is not all that happy...but in 40 yrs olds with 4 kids...that's enough and I'm done. I told DH that either I get tied (having a planned section), he gets sniped, or there is no more sex....\n\nAndrea\u00a0- IVF/Adoption survivor\n\n\n\nPosted 04/11/2013\nHow okay are you with having a husband impose unwanted pregnancies on you? That seems like the unaddressed problem here. I'd be unwilling, even after the surgery, to have sex with someone who wouldn't \"consent\" to my having ownership over my own body.\nPosted 04/11/2013\n\nFunny thing.... I was visiting my parents and my aunt told me that she wanted to get her tubes tied too. She end up not doing it because she heard the elders that had theirs done telling her that when you sleep with your husband, it hurts when you're old. Other than that, I don't think you need your spouse permission although it would be nice to let him know about it.\n\nPosted 04/11/2013\nI can't imagine it being a healthy relationship when you feel the need to hide or not discuss a decision like no more children with your spouse.\n\nI would say more importantly than whether you need his permission is the root of why you can't discuss and decide this together.\n1 2 3\nfirst page | last page\n< Browse more posts\n\nWhat's on your mind?\n\nCreate a new post\nLearn more\n11 months : Week 2\n11 months : Week 3\n11 months : Week 4\n12 months : Week 1\n12 months : Week 2\nLearn more\n\nYour growing child\n\nYour 11-month-old: Week 2\n\n\nLatest Birth Announcement\n\nJuly 2, 2014 at 10:42pm\n8 lbs 7 oz and 22.0 inches\nposted by michisoledad\n\nPlease sign in\n\nThis field is required.\nThis field is required."}

But if he reminds me of anyone, it has to be Rex Ingram. The obsessive sophistication of his visual style \u2013 allied to plots that are anything but. The preoccupation with handsome male proteges, despite a nominal marriage to the leading lady. Oddly, I\u2019ve never seen a film by either director I haven\u2019t liked\u2026but I\u2019m not sure if either ever made a complete masterpiece?\n\n  2. To me L\u2019Herbier is like Sternberg, Minnelli, Alain Resnais and Jacques Demy all at the same time. (With a dash of Jack Smith and Eisenstein\u2019s Ivan the Terrible Part II )\n\n    His films are all about what\u2019s IN the frame rather than \u201coutside\u201d it in montage terms. D\u00e9cor doesn\u2019t simply dominate \u2014 it overwhelms.\n\n  3. One of the images in the article shows Jacque Catelain literally painted to blend in with the scenery, which seems like the ultimate expression of the L\u2019Herbier style.\n\n    The DeMille comparison was inevitable given the fact that we know one influenced the other (I must sit down and watch both versions of The Cheat back-to-back some time), but I agree Ingram makes an intriguing comparison.\n\n    As a theorist-turned-filmmaker, L\u2019Herbier bears crude comparison with Epstein, but Epstein is an outside-the-frame kind of guy.\n\n  4. Michael Powell saw Mare Nostrum being shot and counts it as a defining event in his life. Ingram was to Powell a director in \u201cthe grand style,\u201d and I suspect there\u2019s a trace or two of him in Walbrook\u2019s Lermontov in The Red Shoes.\n\n  5. In LA, Powell would always take his hat off when he passed the car park which used to be Ingram\u2019s studio. One thing he may have taken his cue from is Ingram\u2019s wild humour, which appears at moments some might fine inopportune. That wildness is absent in L\u2019Herbier, who doesn\u2019t go in much for comedy at all (though Michel Simon\u2019s camping it up is fun in Le Bonheur).\n\nLeave a Reply\n\n\nYou are commenting using your account.

He also noted that though the firm currently has about 1,000 workers, in the future, when it begins production of basic steel products needed for a variety of industrial and commercial uses, the sector will generate direct and indirect employment for a sizeable proportion of the population, as well to allied industries."}

Early feminists initial reaction to porn was that it was degrading and objectifying. Later feminists held up certain porn as liberated and empowering. How do things stand now? Being that Farrah Abraham starred in Vivid\u2019s best-selling video ever, Farrah Superstar: Backdoor Teen Mom, she seemed like a natural person to help clear this up for us.\n\nThe Miami New Times\u2019 Cultist got just such an opportunity to ask when offered a phone interview with Abraham about a new Vivid strip club in Miami that she\u2019s promoting (oh, Florida).\n\nDo you consider yourself a feminist?\n\nI\u2019m pretty feminine.

Can you expand on it?\n\nBasically, how my sex tape came about is how I live my life.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just how I live my life. You know, I grip it and rip it. I live life with a lot of butt sex, and squirting.\u201d \u2026Sorry, I couldn\u2019t resist.\n\n\u2026.I\u2019m 22, I\u2019m very sexual, I\u2019m single. A boyfriend of mine at the time, which was James [Deen], is in the industry and makes videos all the time, and so I thought it was a comfortable situation to have my only sex video with him. Proved me wrong, obviously, because it was leaking out, and I was starting to have people reach out to me. Maybe he did that because he wanted to promote his film at the time, The Canyons, which was coming out with Lindsay Lohan. So it turned into a hurtful chain of events, so I involved my lawyer. Other companies were reaching out and wanted to buy it, so I ended up selling it. And against all odds of everybody else telling me not to sell it, not to do it or whatever \u2014 it was already out, it was already going to be out there for free.

{"dataman_score": 4.0, "text": "I\u2019ve been reading in theUK\u2019s Daily Telegraph newspaper in the last couple of days about the troublesome position the UK\u2019s wind turbines are in. As well as being noisy and (according to some) ugly, there are big problems with managing their power output. Apparently, the average wind turbine\u00a0is\u00a0shut down for about 25 days each year because it is too windy. The problem is not that the turbines are in danger of damage \u2013 it\u2019s because supply of electricity outstrips demand. On a windy summer night the generating capacity of the turbines can exceed the consumption of power.\n\nIdeally, this extra energy would be stored and then released when it was required, but there is very limited potential for doing this. This is one of the major issues holding back some of the greener forms of power generation. For example, with solar power, there is great generation potential during the middle of a sunny summer day, but, in many countries, the power consumption is going to peak on a cold winter evening. How do we keep hold of that energy in the meantime? On\u00a0a small-scale it can be done with batteries, fuel cells,supercapacitors, etc., on a larger scale withpump-storage hydro-electric schemes, but on the kind of scale needed to exploit renewable energy fully, we are lacking cost-effective options. In the meantime, the turbines need to be turned off so they don\u2019t overload the grid on windy summer nights.\n\n\u00a0Then there\u2019s also the issue of justhow much greenhouse gas is produced during the construction of a wind turbine, but that\u2019s another story."}

It has taken me a long time to find this peace in my heart. It hasn\u2019t been an easy road to this point and I know that it is not going to be smooth sailing from here either. However, with this I do feel a renewed sense of hope for the future, contentment in the present, as well as pride for my past.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nHill, Rachel - Family Liason Officer\nFinding My Faith\n\n~ Rachael Hill, Survivor\n\nOctober 28, 2012\n\nI don\u2019t normally write about my faithin my blog but something hit me recently that I just have to share.\n\nThis past month my boys and I went to visit some friends out of state. Not just any friends, but my FLO (Family Liaison Officer) and his wife who we have become extremely close with since my husband\u2019s death 27 months ago. I had known Daniel for many years before hebecame my FLO and he had worked very closely with my husband Jeff on numerous occasions, but it wasn\u2019t until he was thrown into this position that his influence became apparent.\n\nWhen assigning a FLO the Air Force wants someone that is not emotionally connected\u2026a requirement that I am so thankful was overlooked in my case. I knew Daniel, Daniel and Jeff were good friends, and to this day I can\u2019t think of a better person I could have had as my FLO. He took this job seriously and went above and beyond to make sure everything I needed was being taken care of. He was official when he needed to be, a friend when I needed one, and gave me spiritual guidance when I needed that. He was the whole package and I cannot say it enough, I absolutely couldnot have gotten through this without him!\n\nNow that you know a little about my FLO Daniel let me move on to my faith.\u00a0 I hate the clich\u00e9 when people say it to me, but I honestly do believe that everything happens for a reason and that God has the ultimate plan. I\u2019m not really a big fan of the plan at this moment in time, but I do believe that He has one with our best intentions in mind. There has to be a reason to this madness. In my heart I believe that Jeff is wherever he is, doing whatever he is doing, and that his job there is more important than the job he was doing here. This belief is often times what gets me through the day. The belief that his death wasn\u2019t in vain and that ultimately there is a purpose. There has to be a purpose. Otherwise what\u2019s the point of anything we do here?\n\nAbout 6 months before Jeff died I started having thoughts that something was going to happen to him, and a few of my friends can even attest to this as I shared these feelings with them. I tried extremely hard to push these thoughts aside but they persisted. As a result, Jeff and I had conversations that people don\u2019t normally have. We shared thoughts and feelings that you don\u2019t normally share and because of this, when he died I had no regrets and very few questions about his thoughts and opinions. I knew his thoughts about me dating again if something happened to him (yes, that was one of the topics we talked about). I knew his feelings about dying in a plane crash, which ironically is how he died. I told him that I would buy a new car, which I did. And most important of all, he knew how much I loved and appreciated him. He knew because I told him!! When I heard the news on July 28th that their plane had gone down, in a sense I wasn\u2019t surprised. I had been prepared for this. God had prepared me for this.\n\nNow back to my visit with Daniel and his family. While at their house late one night we began a conversation about faith and they asked me where I was in my walk with God. I told them that I very strongly believe in the bigger picture that everything happens for a purpose, but that I am having a difficult time with the smaller things regarding my faith. For example, the idea that God loves us, all of us, with everything He is. My response to that is, \u201cif He loves me so much, how could he put me through this?\u201d That just doesn\u2019t seem right! If He loves me, he should want to protect me\u2026not hurt me!\u00a0\n\nAs I explained this, they nodded in understanding and then asked if I had heard Daniel\u2019s story. When I said no he immediately started to share. About a year before Jeff\u2019s accident Daniel had a moment where he realized he needed to work through some personal struggles in his life. While working through this there were other things that came up and more difficulties that needed to be addressed. Then on the night of the accident the squadron asked his opinion as to who my FLO should be, because he and his wife knew both Jeff and I personally. When nobody really came to mind his wife said, \u201cDaniel, you should do it.\u201d Knowing that it would be an extremely difficult job on top of the fact that he had just lost a good friend, there was no hesitation as he stepped up to task.\n\nAt the end of the story he explained how before the events of that year unfolded, he would not have been able to step into the role of a FLO, let alone my FLO. God was preparing his heart to be able to be there for me during my time of need. I was completely taken back by this and started to cry. At that moment my heart was so full of love as I realized God\u2019s love for me. It was no longer a feeling that if He loves me he wouldn\u2019t put me through this. It was then believing that because God loves me, He had not only prepared me for Jeff\u2019s death, but He had also prepared the people around me so that they could be there for me in a way that He knew I would need. Now that is amazing!\n\n\n\nI love this story. Thank you for sharing. I agree I wasn't the biggest fan of Gods' plan at the time, but knowing He was walking through it along side of me brought more comfort than I would have expected.\nPosted by: Elizabeth at 10/29/2012 10:58 AM\n\nNice blog, I believe god uses our own grief and faith experiences,too. I'm looking for the chance to help a close friend with his recent loss,when he is ready. Please keep me in your prayers...............................................************............beth\nPosted by: beth van luven at 10/29/2012 12:12 PM\n\nThis brings tears to my eyes and joy to my heart.

Thank you for being willing to share your heart with us. Deb\nPosted by: Deborah at 10/30/2012 11:13 PM\n\nI am just beginning to reconnect with god. It is not the god I knew before Ryan died by suicide. It is more on a spirit relationship, not sure how it fits in, not what everybody would call christian faith but for the time it is working for me. I lost my faith when I could not find answers and felt god did not love me or my son. that I was not important enough to matter, or hear my prayers. I have been struggling for more than 2 years with these feelings. i know I have a long way back and that I need to do the work if I find the relationship I had prior to Ryan dying.\nPosted by: Ryans mom at 10/31/2012 9:27 PM\n\nWhen you suffer such a loss, as with losing a spouse, I believe the core of your faith is shaken. It is easier to trust God, walk in faith, love Him, and know He loves you when all is going well. The true test of faith and obedience is when tragedy strikes and we either run to God or from Him. When I first lost my husband earlier this year, I know it was my faith that sustained me and got me through the moments, hours and days that followed his sudden passing. I may have not been seeking God as much as I should have but thankfully He was seeking me and carried me through. I pray for you in your continued journey.\nPosted by: Stacey at 11/2/2012 8:18 PM\n\nI would call you right now but I can't find my phone. Thank you for sharing. I'm bawling at my computer right now and hating every second of this pain you have to endure. There is a big picture that we can't see, but sometimes getting those all vision glasses is just a rotten process. Love you friend. You are an inspiration to all!\nPosted by: Leslie at 11/12/2012 11:54 PM\n\nRachael, Thank you for sharing. I always had a strong faith, but the death of my husband has truly challenged it. We met late in life and we considered each other a gift from God. So when he died I had (still do) a tough time understanding why God would take back such a wonderful gift for which I was always so grateful. I had a hard time understand how the loving God I believed in could hurt me and those that loved my husband so much. Instead of turning away from my faith though, I have kept trying to accept and understand. I am now starting to see how God prepared me for this. I too had a premonition something was going to happen. He put me in a good place, surrounded by caring people. It has been 10 months now and this has been a tough journey. Your words inspire me to continue believing that there is more to this life and that God knows what He is doing!\nPosted by: Cindy at 12/3/2012 10:54 AM\n\nPlease read our blog comment policy \u00bb\nLeave a comment\nName *\nEmail *\n\nGo to:\n"}

{"dataman_score": 4.0, "text": "Dentist Leases: Inflation Risks and a Changing Economy\n\nDentist Leases: Inflation Risks and a Changing EconomyBusiness leases were very different back when my father was a mall developer.\n\nAs I described last week, he opened a shopping center in Canada where he prioritized the landlord-tenant relationship. As a landlord, he worked hard to help his tenants achieve success.\n\nUnfortunately, he was unable to cope with the rising costs of operating the shopping centers due to inflation in the 1980\u2032s. Today, malls, strip centers and medical/dental buildings are primarily managed by institutional owners.\n\nTenants are no longer viewed as collaborating business interests; now tenants are commodities to be bought, sold, discarded or traded in favor of the mall owner\u2019s and mall stockholders\u2019 bottom-line.\n\nDental Leases Used To Be Simple\n\nThe most direct result of the inflationary period of the early 1980s was the advent of \u2013 and now widespread use of \u2013 the \u201cnet\u201d form of lease, commonly referred to as the \u201cnet lease\u201d or Triple Net Lease Agreement (NNN). In fact, many tenants cannot even recall a time when the NNN Lease wasn\u2019t in effect.\n\nHowever, prior to the 1980s, most dental leases were, in fact, of a \u201cgross\u201d nature. Under the Gross Lease Agreement the dentist paid one rent, which covered all of the costs a landlord might incur, including such things as parking lot maintenance, insurance, repairs, etc., leaving plenty of room for landlord debt service and profit. Most gross lease rents were set to rise by about 3.0% annually, because inflation for the previous 30 years averaged about 3.2% per annum during the post-War era,1 making such an agreement simple to manage for both landlord and his dental tenant.\n\nBut when the costs of operating malls and other commercial properties unexpectedly and quickly began to rise as a result of higher inflation, the mall and property owners were forced to absorb the additional expenses, thereby cutting into their profit margins.\n\nThis forced mall owners such as my father to pay both higher mortgage rates and rising operating costs. When inflation was finally contained at the expense of the mall owners rather than the retailers and shoppers, it forced many early developers into bankruptcy and malls into foreclosure.\n\nThe Triple Net Lease Becomes Standard\n\nWhen the foreclosed shopping centers were ultimately resold to other interests, the new shopping center owners applied the lessons they had learned from their bankrupt predecessors, and redrafted their lease agreements to transfer inflation risks to their tenants through the NNN Lease.\n\nAs the long-term tenant agreements of the 1970s began to expire in the 1990s, the landlords would not renew the previous gross lease agreements unless they were revised to their current standard NNN Lease form, which incorporates both rising rents set to Consumer Price Index (CPI) increases and direct flow through of all operating costs to their tenants along with hefty admin fees.\n\nThe result will make managing through the next inflationary period considerably more difficult for retailers and other tenants, just as it did for the early mall developers in the 1980\u2032s.\n\nDentists Now Take the Risk\n\nDuring the economic boom years of the 2000s, the typical landlord form lease agreement evolved in terms of both their complexity and sophistication, with\u00a0the bulk of new risks being borne by the tenant.\n\nHowever, few \u2013 if any \u2013 dental tenants really understood or appreciated the potential inflationary risks they were being asked to absorb should the economy enter into another inflationary period. For many, it wasn\u2019t even a business consideration, as most dentists had not operated a practice through the period of high inflation of the 1970s and early 1980s, and those that did have since retired.\n\nFurther, the dentists could only secure good locations through a highly-charged competitive environment, encouraged by the landlords, and often manipulated by the brokerage community.\n\nThe result, in my view, is the creation of conditions now set for the \u201cperfect inflationary storm.\u201d I\u2019ll describe what I mean \u2013 and what you can do to protect yourself \u2013 next week.\n\nBibliography1 Rattner, Steven (January 5, 1981) \u201cFederal Reserve Sees Little Growth in \u201981 with Continued High Rates,\u201d New York Times\n\nAbout Lewis Gelmon\n\nLewis Gelmon is a professional lease negotiator, educator advocate for the dental community and lives in San Diego, CA, with over 22 years of experience in the field.

The pope wields vast influence as the world's most powerful moral leader.\n\nPope Francis of Buenos Aires, formerly Cardinal Jorge Bergoglio, emerged from the conclave as the first pope from outside Europe in modern times, the first Jesuit, the first from Latin America, and the first named Francis, in recollection of St. Francis of Assisi, who dedicated his life to helping the poor.\n\n\nThe Orthodox Union lauded Pope Francis for his solidarity with the Argentinean Jewish community and expressed hope that the Pope \"will be an active force in the battle against those who would use religion as a justification for violence and intolerance.\"\n\nAbraham Foxman, National Director of the Anti-Defamation League, issued the following statement after the election Wednesday: \"We believe that the election of Francis is a significant moment in the history of the Church. We look forward to working with him to continue to foster Catholic-Jewish relations as we have with his predecessors. There is much in his record that reassures us about the future.\"\n\nPawan Deshpande, a member of the Hindu American Foundation Executive Council, congratulated the Catholic Church, but expressed a desire for change from the tenure of Benedict XVI. Some Hindus consider the former pope's reign as a lost opportunity for dialogue.\n\n\"As a pluralistic faith, Hindus respect the papacy for its importance to Catholics, and hope that the Church now begins a new era of mutually respecting Dharma religions and other pluralist traditions as divinely inspired paths as well,\" Deshpande said in a statement Wednesday.\n\nThe Council on American-Islamic Relations, a leading Muslim civil rights group in Washington, offered its support to the new pope, after somewhat difficult relations between the Muslim world and the Vatican during Benedict's tenure.\n\n\nCopyright 2015\n\nRead the original story: What non-Catholics think of the new pope\n\n\nSign up for your All Access Subscription\n\nDownload our apps!\n\nStay connected with FLORIDA TODAY's apps: iPhone app | Android app\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoin the conversation\n\nConnect with us on Facebook\nChoose from 16 topics to follow\nFollow us on Twitter\nFollow our latest activity\nSend a letter\nShare your opinion with a letter to the editor"}
{"dataman_score": 4.0, "text": "Rangers legend Andy Goram says Ibrox giants can spring knockout shock should they draw Celtic in League Cup\n\nTHE former Scotland goalkeeper admits he is desperate for the Third Division side to draw rivals Celtic in the League Cup quarter-finals.\n\nAndy Goram\n\nANDY GORAM insists Rangers have nothing to fear from a League Cup clash with Celtic and is praying the old rivals are set on collision course today.\n\nHoops legend Tommy Burns paid the ultimate tribute to the former Ibrox No.1 when he said: \u201cThey will put on my tombstone Andy Goram broke my heart.\u201d\n\nNow Goram hopes former Scotland boss Bobby Brown, another ex-Gers keeper, hands Ally McCoist\u2019s men the chance to break the hearts of the SPL champions when he helps make today\u2019s quarter-final draw.\n\nNeil Lennon\u2019s troops will be hot favourites if they come out of the hat alongside their bitter enemies, especially after Tuesday\u2019s stunning Euro win over Spartak Moscow.\n\nBut Goram insists Third Division Gers can spring a shock after toppling SPL high-flyers Motherwell in the last round.\n\nAnd he intends to take advantage if the bookies offer generous odds on his old club again. The 48-year-old said: \u201cI really want to play Celtic. It\u2019s time we had an Old Firm game \u2013 everyone feels the same.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re only a quarter of the way into the season and everyone in the country is missing it.\n\n\u201cEven the most bitter Rangers and Celtic fans can\u2019t say they\u2019re not missing the derbies as they are the best games in the world.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t fear for Rangers \u2013 that game would take care of itself.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d bet Rangers. Motherwell have had a fantastic start to the season and fully deserve to be at the top of the league. But they were favourites at Ibrox, despite not having won there in a million years, and I thought that was strange.\n\n\u201cRangers were 6-4 and that amazed me but that\u2019s how it is in Scottish football right now.\n\n\u201cSponsors would want an Old Firm final. It would be unbelievable. I think Rangers need to play Celtic. But we\u2019ll wait and see if there\u2019s a hot ball and a cold one at the draw.\u201d\n\nRangers have suffered something of a culture shock since tumbling down to the bottom tier.\n\nMost of their matches at Ibrox have turned into a stroll but it has been a different story on the road and they have struggled away to Peterhead, Berwick, Annan and Forres.\n\nGoram hasn\u2019t been too surprised by that and insists even Walter Smith\u2019s Nine-in-a-Row heroes found the going tough when they faced minnows away from home in domestic cup competitions.\n\nGoram said: \u201cIn my day it was easier for us to play at Elland Road and Marseille than it was to play at Annan and Peterhead.\n\n\u201cWe went down to play a Third Division team during the 1990s \u2013 I can\u2019t remember who it was but it was an absolute nightmare. The game was played on public pitch and there was just one railing around it.\n\n\u201cIt was the same when we played San Marino with Scotland \u2013 it was on a public pitch and it\u2019s hard work to get yourself going.\n\n\u201cAt Ibrox we\u2019re fine because we\u2019re used to that environment but playing away from home is a culture shock.\n\n\u201cOn the road it\u2019s not so much ability that matters, it\u2019s attitude.\n\n\u201cYou have to earn the right to play. First you have to win your battles and then you can play.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy for people on the outside to look at what\u2019s happening and say Rangers are not doing well away from home. When I played for the club we had to do it maybe once or twice in a season at most and it\u2019s not easy to lift your game.\n\n\u201cBut you are a professional and you are playing at a big club.\n\n\u201cThese Rangers boys are doing it every other week so they need to get it going pretty quickly. It\u2019s just a case of getting their heads around it and getting stuck in.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s where the likes of Lee McCulloch, Neil Alexander and Ian Black, the senior players, come in. The young boys have been brilliant but Lee has been the stand-out.\u201d\n\nGoram played with McCulloch when the Rangers skipper was starting his career at Motherwell.\n\nThey both shared a dressing room with Kevin Twaddle \u2013 and Goram was at Fir Park yesterday to help launch the former winger\u2019s book, A Life On The Line.\n\nTwaddle speaks candidly about his gambling addiction and how he lost \u00a31million due to his habit.\n\nGoram praised Twaddle for his refreshing honesty and admits he also fell victim to the gambling and drinking culture within the game.\n\nHe said: \u201cI\u2019ve all the respect in the world for Kevin. We\u2019ve all had a bet, it was the same with me.\n\n\u201cWhen I first started playing in the 1980s if you went back to the club in the afternoon it was a punishment. Usually you went to the bookies, the pub or a snooker hall \u2013 and if you were really lucky, all three.\n\n\u201cThat was the way of life. You had a drink, a laugh and a gamble \u2013 90 per cent of footballers did that.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great Kevin is now showing young players what can happen.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve not been drinking for 11 months and if I could give young players advice I would tell them to be wary of alcohol.\n\n\u201cIf someone can learn from it and take the right road rather than the roads Kevin and I went down, then fine. It would help everybody.\u201d\n\nGoram was impressed by Twaddle\u2019s ability when they played together at Fir Park and was surprised he didn\u2019t go on to play for a bigger club.\n\nHe said: \u201cPeople forget what a good player Kevin was but he should have played at a higher level. I got a text off him a few years ago and it said: \u2018On this minute seven years ago I scored the winner against Celtic at Parkhead.\u2019 Motherwell beat them 1-0 that night with 10 men.\n\n\u201cHe remembered the exact date and minute. Kevin was a great player but he tries to tell me he\u2019s not a Rangers fan.\u201d"}

For racers, that has meant keeping at least two extra crystal sets ready to resolve frequency conflicts at the track. Even if you aren't a racer, chances are you've had to buy at least one extra set of crystals to avoid being on the same channel as another guy at the local hot spot or to replace a set of crystals that went bad.\n\nWell, you can forget all that. Crystal-free technology has arrived, and JR Racing is the first to offer a radio system with a crystal-free transmitter and receiver that have been designed and manufactured in-house to work together. They're part of the new XS3 package, and we've got all the test data you're looking for.\n\nWhat does this button do?\nThe XS3 has a thumb switch (grip button \"C\") that can be used for three functions, depending on your needs:\n\n\u2022 Emergency Steering. If you select this mode, activating the switch will override the dual-rate steering setting to give you full steering throw. This is useful if you've dialed out much of your car's steering but find you need to make a U-turn to get out of a crash. If you can get back into the race without waiting for a marshal, you'll have a real advantage.\n\n\u2022 Lap Timer. The XS3 uses an \"up timer,\" which means it starts at zero and counts up. Once the lap timer has been activated, each consecutive press of grip button \"C\" records a lap. Up to 50 laps can be stored, and you can scroll through them on the LCD screen.\n\n\u2022 Gear-Shift Toggle. This mode is for those who drive third-channel-reverse trucks. It activates the third servo, and each button click sends the servo to the end of its travel range (as set by you with the endpoint function).\n\nMore on that third channel...\nGrip button \"C\" can't be used for proportional third-channel control, but that doesn't mean the XS3 lacks this capability. If you assign grip lever \"A\" to the third channel, it will operate the third servo proportionally when you click the switch in the direction you want the servo to go. This is perfect for making onboard fuel/air mixture adjustments in nitro vehicles (not done much in cars, but it's common in boats), or you could use it to make a wing servo-adjustable or operate \"special-effects\" functions. How about a rotating turret on your touring car?\n\nXS3 features\nThe XS3 has the same primary features and case as the XR3i, which are explained in detail in February's \"Product Probe\" XR3i review.

{"dataman_score": 4.0, "text": "'The Biggest Loser' Recap: A 5K While the Trainers Are Away\nChrissa Hardy\nChrissa Hardy\nContributing Writer, BuddyTV\nThe group doesn't have much time to grieve the exit of Cate before Alison shows up with the three trainers. Alison lets everyone know that three more people will leave the ranch that very night. WHAT?! Exhale, guys. It's the trainers. They will be leaving for the week to visit the kids and train with them. The trainers are all scared to leave the teams on their own, but they have the teams write down homework and instructions for the coming week. Bob, Jillian and Dolvett will be back for the last chance workout, but they need to put in the work on their own until then.\u00a0\n\n\nBob goes to see Biingo and he's doing really well! His mom has lost weight too, by staying on the same healthy eating plan as Biingo. They have healthy food in the fridge, and despite their recent financial struggles that have forced them to move into a relative's basement, they feel like they're on the right track. Bob takes Biingo to the local Minor League baseball field to have a catch with their star pitcher.\n\nBack at the Ranch\n\nThe red team is trying push just as hard despite Dolvett's absence. The plan for them is to do the same exact workouts as they would normally do with him. Justin has even stepped up as the loud time keeper. I can see him now, at Fitness Ridge, as the latest addition to training staff. The white team only has two members, so they do everything Jillian told them to do, and they do it together. Blue team is the powerhouse. They have decided to have a different leader each day while Bob is gone.\u00a0\n\n\nJillian has a heart to heart with Sunny at home. We learn that Sunny is an extreme stress-eater. Her family wants her to be a doctor, so she has spread herself thin with advanced classes and extra curricular activities that she really isn't interested in, just to please her parents. She stifles her stress and unhappiness with food, and instead of getting angry with her parents for the pressure they've put on her, she has the weight to use as an excuse. Jillian wants to have a family meeting, so that Sunny can finally be honest about her dreams. Jillian sits down with Sunny's mom and this gives Sunny the opportunity to have an honest conversation about the future that she wants for herself. Sunny's mom is very receptive and makes it clear that she will support Sunny no matter what. Jillian's big surprise for Sunny is to give rowing crew a try. Jillian actually has a harder time with it than Sunny does!\u00a0\n\n\nDolvett heads over to Lindsay's house and chats with the family. Her mom has been working out with her in the morning and her sister has been exercising with her in the afternoon. The energy in her house has completely changed. There's happiness here. It's just lighter. Lindsay is clearly making progress. Dolvett also talks to her about the bullies in her school. She wants to be a cheerleader and she quit in middle school because of some terrible mean girls. Dolvett surprises her with some cheerful support from the high school cheerleading team.\u00a0\n\nThe Challenge\n\nThe group is running their first 5K, to benefit The Boys and Girls Club of America. Just for participating, $7,500 will go to the local chapter. For the competition, the team that crosses the finish line first will get $15,000 to split between them. The second place team will get $5,000 and third place will get $2,500. Everyone wins! Danni finishes first, with Joe close behind. Pam crosses in third place. White team gets first place for $15,000, red gets second place and blue comes in third.\u00a0\n\nLast Chance Workout\n\nThe trainers are back for the last chance workout. Blue and white team up for the workout. Blue starts out sluggish. The week without him has been rough and they haven't been pushing themselves. Red team is doing well, aside from Joe. As Jackson has found his voice, Joe as lost his athletic drive. He takes breaks, makes excuses, and Dolvett is disappointed in his performance. Hopefully he catches on.\u00a0\n\nBack over at Bob's box, Jillian is riding the blue fellas. She sees Jeff half-assing each station. When she calls him out, he snaps back. Yikes, not smart, bro. He's not interested in Jillian's technique. He doesn't enjoy the harshness of her words and her belittling manner. Jillian sees a guy with extreme potential, in every aspect of this life. His attitude is clearly getting in his way. She sends him back to Bob. Bob isn't too happy with Jillian either. He's not okay with the way she's yelling at Jeff when he can see that Jeff is trying.\u00a0\n\nThe Weigh In\n\nBlue is up first. Michael is up first for blue and loses 12 lbs. David loses 9 lbs. Alex loses 4 lbs. Gina loses 9 lbs. Jeff is the last one up and loses 6 lbs. The team's total is 40 lbs.\u00a0\n\nRed team is up next and needs to lose at least 30 lbs to be safe from elimination. Joe loses 7 lbs. Francelina loses 6 lbs. Lisa loses 9 lbs. Jackson is up last and loses 12 lbs! Red is safe! The team's total ends up being 34 lbs.\n\nWhite is up last and needs to lose 13 lbs. If they lose, the person that loses less, goes home immediately. No vote needed. Danni loses 6 lbs. Pam needs to lose 7 lbs to protect white. She loses 3 lbs. She gets sent home. White is down to 1 member.\u00a0\n\nThe Check In\n\nBack in New York, Pam looks amazing. She has lost a total of 55 lbs since she first arrived on the ranch. She gets her own makeover, since she didn't make it to Makeover Week. She's really excited to start her life again. GO PAM!\n\nThe Biggest Loser airs Mondays on NBC at 8pm.\n\n(Image courtesy of NBC)\n\nNews from our partners"}

The morphology, composition, and electronic structure of the composites were characterized by using transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectrometer, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Based on the fast redox property of PPy and high conductivity of graphene, the prepared composite film could be constructed to a supercapacitor device directly. The electrochemical performances of the supercapacitor were investigated by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge\u2013discharge, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The composites showed better electrochemical performances than the individual components. A high specific capacitance of 335 F\u00b7g $^{-1}$ was obtained with the capacitance retention of 85% after 1000 cycles at a current density of 1 A\u00b7g $^{-1}$ by charge\u2013discharge analysis between 0 and +1.0\u00a0V. The enhanced specific capacitance and cycling life implied a synergistic effect of graphene and PPy.\n\nIEEE Trans. Nanotech. 11,6,1080(Nov. 2012)\n\n\nComments are closed."}

It doesn't seem like AMD has the architecture or the fabrication advantage of ARM or Intel to get so low power consumption, but I'd love to be surprised and have them be a good competitor in this space. We all know they won't catch up in desktops and laptops in performance per watt, hopefully in a new market they can. Reply\n  \u2022 frozentundra123456 - Tuesday, January 15, 2013 - link\n\n    It looks nice, but I am comcerned about cpu performance. If it is 800.00 compared to 900 to 1000.00, I would have to strongly consider the IVB more powerful tablet. Seems like 700 ish would be a more appropriate price point. Reply\n  \u2022 NichrolasHoult - Wednesday, January 16, 2013 - link\n\n\n    Happy New Year!\n  \u2022 twotwotwo - Tuesday, January 15, 2013 - link\n\n    When I really think about it, I know I should wait maybe a yearish for Haswell to come out and Ubuntu to get usable enough on tablets. Besides, my 'old' laptop isn't _that_ old, and works fine.\n\n    When I don't really think about it, I want one of these. :)\n  \u2022 kyuu - Tuesday, January 15, 2013 - link\n\n    I'm definitely looking forward to this tablet. However, I hope you're wrong on the price point. Considering there are Atom-powered Win8 tablets in the $500-600 range, and AMD's chipset should be significantly cheaper than Intel's, I was more expecting this to be in that range, *maybe* ~$700. Granted the 1080p panel instead of 1366x768 is going to drive the price up a bit, but I still don't see this being competitive at a price approaching that of Ivy Bridge tablets.\n\n    If they bring this in at $600 or cheaper, it's pretty much an instant buy for me. $600-700 I'll definitely consider it. Any more than that, I don't really think I can justify it over getting a touchscreen laptop... like Vizio's refreshed 14\" Thin+Light.\n  \u2022 LordConrad - Tuesday, January 15, 2013 - link\n\n    I'm glad to see AMD has a horse in this race, their low-end chips are much better than the Atom. This might change when Intel updates Atom to support Out-of-Order execution, but for now AMD rules the x86 low-end. Reply\n  \u2022 Shadowmaster625 - Tuesday, January 15, 2013 - link\n\n    Way way way waaaaaaay too expensive. Wow. Two years ago you could buy a C-50 tablet with 32GB SSD for $500. Hell it was on sale for $450 several times. 64GB of SSD costs less than 32GB costed back then. The same 2GB of RAM costs less. The battery costs less. The panel probably costs $50 more. The SoC probably $20 more. So where in blazes do you get off even speculating $700? Where do these outrageous numbers keep coming from? The bill of materials on this thing cant possibly be over $400.

I have a smartphone to keep me appraised of things like that. A tablet for me doesn't need to replicate the connected-standby function of the computer I have in my pocket all the time anyway.\n  \u2022 themossie - Wednesday, January 16, 2013 - link\n\n    Not a problem for your use case (or, I suspect, most use cases) but I know some strange people...\n\n    A surprising number of my non-techie friends don't have smartphones, and rely on a tablet as their main computer at home. Several of these have data plans for their tablets.\n\n    On my last smartphone, battery life was at a premium so I left background data off - relying on my tablet for notifications. I'd argue this is one of the few advantages of a tablet over a laptop for power users :-) But... yeah, most people use their smartphones for this.

While GFLOPS aren't everything, they do give you some idea of the performance delta between the best current mobile GPU and a relatively poor performing desktop part. Reply\n  \u2022 twtech - Friday, January 18, 2013 - link\n\n    And to put that into context against high-end desktop GPUs, they are up in the 3,000-3,500 GFLOPS range, with the next generation coming soon expected to be up around 5,000 GFLOPS.\n\n    I think some people start thinking, \"My tablet has a 2GHz quad-core processor. Desktops only have 3ish GHz quad-core processors, so that means tablets will be as powerful as desktop PCs soon.\"\n  \u2022 tipoo - Wednesday, January 16, 2013 - link\n\n    Still far behind the HD4000.

Seems like a must-have nowadays...\n  \u2022 Death666Angel - Wednesday, January 16, 2013 - link\n\n    I've been researching Windows 8 laptops and x86 tablet for the past week. Just out of curiosity mostly, as I am happily using my desktop old i3-330UM 11.6\" laptop and 10.1\" Android tablet still. I have no real need for any upgrades.\n    But the Asus 13.3\" AMD A6-4555M 1080p laptop for 800\u20ac (Vivobook U38N) is pretty enticing as is the UX32 with a GT620M (better performance but at 1050\u20ac much too expensive compared to the AMD offering for me). Now this tablet is just as interesting with the internals. Though price needs to be 700\u20ac or below in my opinion.\n    But I don't need any of those right now and considering that much better tech is just around the corner, I'm hoping for more powerful products at better prices in the fall of this year or early next year. :)\n  \u2022 duploxxx - Wednesday, January 16, 2013 - link\n\n    according your feedback.\n\n    its smoother in usage, cpu powerfull enough, gpu much better and according the specs low power usage.\n\n    yet all oem provide the atoms and none to find with AMD.... consumer is yet again loosing.

Reply\n  \u2022 B3an - Wednesday, January 16, 2013 - link\n\n    It's a Win 8 feature. The hardware has to support it. Reply\n  \u2022 Wolfpup - Wednesday, January 16, 2013 - link\n\n    I have a tiny notebook based on AMD's C50 that I bought last year. C50 appears to be the exact same hardware-dual core Bobcat (basically a stripped down Athlon 64) @ 1Ghz + 80 VLW5 slowish clocked GPU cores, only the C50 could draw 9 watts versus this thing's 4.5.\n\n    I remember thinking last year what a great chip that would be for a tablet, and...here it is.\n\n    It's sluggish, but not unusable, and of course \"sluggish\" is relative, as it's running a real full OS with real multitasking, yet still outperforms my iPad 2 with it's dual core A9s on a limited OS without much real multitasking.\n  \u2022 Wolfpup - Tuesday, February 12, 2013 - link\n\n    The more I think about this, the less interested I am in Atom tablets. I know for a fact z60 can play back video fairly well (and even accelerate Flash)...25% more single threaded performance and a bajillion times better GPU (not to mention better driver support)...I'm really wishing Dell and HP had used z60 for their tablets too. Reply\n  \u2022 haukionkannel - Wednesday, January 16, 2013 - link\n\n    Tablets are very good for reading, so good GPU that allows smooth scrolling is actually very good compromise for tablet CPUGPU. I am not so interested in Hasvel tablets, bacause they most propably are way too expensive, but this and the next generation Atoms can be something that can compete with ARM based tablets. Hasvel based will be in their own league and more like very portable laptops, with removeable keyboards. Very good and fast items, but 1000$+ price will keep them in very different category than these portable electronics books! (allmost like softcover vs hardcover novel :-) Reply\n  \u2022 zaddie63 - Friday, January 18, 2013 - link\n\n    Hi I have been reading your reviews for over 10 years and they are always great. I noticed that you are planning to review another tablet and I had some thoughts.\n\n    I am typing this comment on a Gigabyte S1080 tablet that I installed windows 8 on.\n    It has a Windows cpu experience rating of 3.4. the new z2760 also gets 3.4. In another test someone did and posted the test results online, along with what Intel released, I saw that the N2800 cpu was supposed to be faster than the N570 that I have.\n\n    How come my cpu which is two releases old has the same rating as the new z2760, when the previous generation was supposed to be faster than mine and the Z2760 is supposed to be so fantastic.\n\n    Reviews of tablets tend to get treated like cellular phone revise. Talk about the hardware and run some IE test. For your next tablet review I'd appreciate it very much and I know a lot of other people would as well, sine tablets are on the rise and as we use them for business we need to know the truth about their performance in business and not how well they run sunspider.\n\n    I'd like to see a full suite of laptop type tests run on tablets (preferably) running the Z2760, the N570, the N2800, the Amd Z60, and I3 or I5.\n\n    Gigabyte has 4 tablets running all of the above, you may be able to get a Samsung s7 which has an I5, then there are the Acer, Asus and Samsung which you already know about. Compare them to laptops, because that is the business decision a lot of FCs are looking at.\n\n    I know it will make great reading.\n  \u2022 tabletpc99 - Wednesday, June 05, 2013 - link\n\n    hello guys, please free to check our videos of mini pad - 7.85 inch IPS screen Quad Cor Tablet PC <TWY-4785> on youtube, our username: Johnsonchen99, thanks a lot!\n    our skype: tablewarmyou\n\nLog in\n\nDon't have an account?

However, the Al Stall Jr. runner didn't receive any favors in the post position draw, receiving the far outside in a strong 11-horse field that includes New Orleans H.

Read More\n\n\nWhat the Nation is saying about Outside Post for Blame in Foster...\n\nShould he win the Stephen Foster Handicap at Churchill Downs today? I think that Blame would then have to be the only other older colt that would potentially be considered at the level that Quality Road is at right now racing over conventional dirt. Quality Road's achievements are more impressive because he has more than one Grade 1 victory to his credit. Blame, while having won 5 of 6 races over conventional dirt, and his only loss being a 2nd to Regal Ransom in the Super Derby, has yet to land a Grade 1 Stakes. He has three Grade 2 win's. One Grade 3 win. Plus, he also has one allowance win and a win in the Curlin Stakes, which is a listed stakes. But I don't think there's any question that Blame is colt that's more than ready to face Grade 1 competition. The Stephen Foster Handicap should be a very good gauge as to how this colt will handle the step up in competition. Should he win the Stephen Foster today? I'd love the prospect of Blame going to Saratoga as well this summer and potentially facing Quality Road in either the Whitney Handicap or the Woodward Stakes. Which are the two races that Todd Pletcher has stated Quality Road will race in at Saratoga this summer.\n\nRelated Pages\n\nRelated Stories\n\nTop Stories"}

{"dataman_score": 4.0, "text": "How to measure the speed of sound\n\nThere's a simple way to measure the speed of sound. It's low tech and unimpressive, but you get to blast an air horn. How many times can you say that you're using one for science and not sheer obnoxiousness?\n\nSometimes the simplest solution is the best solution. That's not the case here, since measuring the speed of sound precisely depends on some sophisticate equipment. Not only does the measurement have to be exact, but other factors, such as temperature and humidity come into play. For those not interested in delicate engineering, though, making a general estimate of the speed of sound is a straightforward process.\n\nFind an area with plenty of flat open space and no one around to call the police and make a noise complaint. Armed with a buddy, an air horn (or anything that will make a loud noise on cue), a spool of string, and a timer or watch, stake out a place and get started. Your friend will hold on to one end of the spool of string and start blasting the horn, clanging the cymbals, banging the drum slowly, or just making whatever racket you two have agreed on. You will back up slowly, holding the other end of the string and using the timer to measure the time between when you see your friend making the noise and when the noise hits you.\n\nAt first the sound will seem to reach you at pretty much the same time as the light does. However, as you back farther and farther away, a delay will become apparent. Have your friend keep making the noise until you get a few consistent measurements for the time delay. Note them down in seconds, and mark how far along the string you are. By measuring the length of the string \u2013 and so the length of the distance between you \u2013 and dividing that by the number of seconds you measured as a delay, you'll get the approximate speed of sound.\n\nThis seems like an easy explanation, but it also comes with a challenge. The speed of sound in air is about 343 meters per second. The speed of sound in sea water, where you can also do this experiment, providing you have a big body of water, waterproof equipment, and are making sure you aren't deafening whales, is 1500 meters per second. But what is the speed of sound in gummy bears? In marshmallow? In chocolate sauce?\n\nIo9ers, go forth and measure. If we don't have a calculated value for the speed of sound in a melty ice cream sundae by the end of the week, I will consider this entry a failure.\n\nHow to measure the speed of sound\n\n(If you're not willing to experiment, at least write in and tell me how many of you want a sundae right now.)"}

See what some Stockholmers think and chime in with your own views on The Local's Have Your Say.\n\nWith Obama and Romney still neck and neck in the final hours of a hard-fought and costly presidential election campaign, polls indicate the race could still go either way.\n\nThe vast majority of Swedes living in Sweden prefer the Democratic Party and Barack Obama over the Republicans and Mitt Romney, according to statistics collected by daily Aftonbladet.\n\n89 percent of Swedes would like to see Obama win the 2012 US election, according to the paper\u2019s poll.\n\nWhen The Local took a straw poll of Stockholm residents about the Obama-Romney race, they all answered similarly.\n\n\nMeanwhile, a joint investigation by CNN in Sweden and Swedish analytics firm United Minds showed that US cities with Swedish-sounding names were predominantly conservative.\n\nAnd oddsmakers also seem to think that Obama will emerge victorious - but will he?\n\nWhen the dust settles, which candidate will be able to call the White House home?\n\nWhat will the result of the 2012 presidential race mean for Sweden and its relations with the United States?\n\nAnd why are Swedes and the Swedish media so fascinated by the race for the White House?\n\n\nRelated links:\n\nThe Local (news@thelocal.se)\n\nDon't miss...X\nLeft Right\n\nYour comments about this article\n\n19:40 November 5, 2012 by Iraniboy\nDear Thelocal,\n\nI noticed in the previous article that you mention Obama's support which 89% among Swedes. However you don't mention in either of article Romney's support which I assume is around 4%! Is it too humiliating to mention that? In either case it just shows that Swedes have no argument about this election so what should they say?\n03:38 November 6, 2012 by Eric1\nWhile I love Sweden and have a lot of Swedish friends, I find they are very shallow, don't understand economics, have very little ideal of what life is like in America. They except what is told to them without question. It's not their fault. It's the fault of an education system that values socialistic ideals over math, science, history, etc.... The television news broadcast all promote far left leaning stories. Plus, they get CNN, that is dying in the USA because it's just a joke. CNN just a leftist propaganda machine. (let's see if my comments get a rise)\n10:07 November 6, 2012 by fikatid\n@Eric1: I'm an American who happens to live in Sweden. I totally disagree with what you said. I graduated from a top 10 US national university and found that your comments to be nothing but lies that the Fox News have implanted in many uneducated narrow-minded people like yourself. I feel pity for you for how gullible you are.\n10:55 November 6, 2012 by martin8558\n\nI can not agree with you more I am also American who lives in Sweden, everyone knows that Mr bill and Fox News is Anti Obama!\n11:28 November 6, 2012 by markusd\nThe common theme with all of these on-the-street interviews is something like, \"I don't follow or know anything about American politics, but I want Obama to win.\"\n\nI'd really like to know how Europeans would feel if they were put into this situation: First, you have a guy who increases your and each member of your family's share of your country's debt from somewhere around $18,000 to about $30,000 over 8 years. If you're like me, this would make you very angry. Then the second guy comes along, calls the first guy 'unpatriotic' for increasing the debt by such a large amount before proceeding to increase your share of the debt from around $30,000 to over $50,000 in only 4 years! To top it all off, you have a bunch of people from other countries who have no connection to the debt that either one of these two idiots gave you, trying to tell you how wonderful the second guy is.\n11:35 November 6, 2012 by Scambaiter\nEric1 is what is commonly known as a neocon troll\n\nAs for markusd...you cannot be serious? Are you seriously blaming the \"debt\" and the financial crisis on Obama?\n\nThe \"wonderful\" thing about Obama is that he didn't start two hugely expensive wars, one of them illegal and on a false WMD premise (doesn't including the \"war against terrorism\")\n\nIt's not always just about the money...dum, dum. de, dum, dum\n11:44 November 6, 2012 by CJ from Sunshine Desserts\nAs a Brit, I\u00b4m continually being reminded by Americans that if it wasn`t for them & the boys who died in Normandy etc..we`d all be speaking German or the usual cold war one about Russia. I\u00b4ve also met just as many yanks who need to visit a dentist, something they always jibe us Brits for. In the US both candidates are not so far apart, however one of them might bring us closer to WW III if he supports Israel a bit too much. Like all other EU folk I don`t understand US politics, although interest group lobbying seems to be rife there. Remember it was actually Obama who saved the auto industry. Would feel a bit uneasy with a Mourmon in the WH, after all their church`s stance on afro-americans & women is a wee bit outdated & immoral.\n12:34 November 6, 2012 by Roy E\nI oftentimes find European comments regarding American politics simultaneously amusing and tragic.\n\nIt's amusing to see wildly off base the conclusions uttered with such certitude and stridency. One almost feels embarrassed for the speaker's disconnect from the reality because in many cases, it's not the individual's fault.\n\nIt's sad because so many conclusions are based on bad and/or incomplete information. People do not get the full story from the media. On both sides of the ocean, the media is guilty of two sins: sins of commission and sins of omission. The result is selective, biased reporting designed to create a desired narrative. Instead of providing all the facts so that one can form their own conclusion, the media presents is what they want you to believe.\n\nA fine example is Sveriges Radio. Whenever the topic of America comes up, it's like taking a trip to an alternate universe. The listener does not get a report. They get get as you get a presentation trying to drive you to a predetermined conclusion about how you should think and what you should believe. It's truly sad. It reminds me of a cattle drive.\n\nBut this same distorted presentation of the news happens in the American Media as well. This bias created a huge market for Fox News because people knew that instead of the full story, they were getting agenda-driven narratives from mainstream media. Fox News stepped into this new reporting void and is now vilified by the Left because they dare challenge the monopoly on the narrative they once held on the narrative. (There are also a couple British reporters who report on America more accurately than the legacy American media. Hats off to them.)\n\nFox News is extremely disturbing to prejudiced Lefties pursuing their confirmation bias. It truly 'harshes their mellow' to have their ideas challenged and contradicted.\n\nYes, The \"Be tolerant or we will destroy you' crowd' gets very angry when people have the temerity to suggest that there may be more than one side (their side) to a story.\n\nIsn't that true, fikatid?\n13:24 November 6, 2012 by momscar\nCJ, did the powers that be in Sweden do anything to save Volvo from the Chinese or save Saab from going under?? Yet you praise Obama for saving American auto. The problem with our automakers are unions and I think someone that actually has business experience could have turned it around.\n\nNobody vetted Obama prior to the last election and they refuse to report anything negative now. Just look at our ambassador in Libya. He doesn't want to investigate what happened until after the election. Pffffftt. He LIED from day 1, and anyone that didn't think that this was a planned attack on SEPT 11, is a fool,\n\nAmerica isn't supposed to be a cradle to grave socialist country but that is Obama's vision. Most of his upbringing was around Marxist sympathizers.\n\nDid you know that if he wasn't president he would not be able to get enough security clearance to sweep the situation room?? He can thank his good friend William Ayers for that.\n\nYou may think that Obama is good for the rest of the world, but he is not good for America, and after all, that's what counts..\n\nRoy E. \"thumbs up\"\n19:19 November 6, 2012 by CJ from Sunshine Desserts\nmomscar: He did save the auto industry by bailing it out, one of the first things he did as president. Whats wrong with socialism ? free healthcare ? Another thing, at least 50% of Americans who will vote today disagree with you. Volvo, VW, Audi, BMW, Mercedes, Renault, FIAT are all unionised & there is nothing wrong with them. If you live in Sweden you pay more tax on your salary, but as I point out the healthcare is free, chemotherapy, operations won`t bankrupt you like in the US ..there is no cut-off either. If you live in Sweden & you love Bush & Romney then go back to\u00b4your beloved America, just wait until you get sick or have an accident or get sacked ! Yanks are brainwashed & ignorant, that way they are easier to control.\n22:29 November 6, 2012 by Eric1\nfikatid: Thank you for your kind words. Leftist are always so polite and respectful.\n23:29 November 6, 2012 by Richard S\nThere are many things wrong with America. But America did not get\n\nto be a super power by disregarding human enterprise and letting the\n\ngovernment do everything. I do not and never have depended on the\n\ngovernment except for national security. I have worked for myself and\n\nfamily. Paid for everything including healthcare as it was my responsibility.\n\nThose who do not want responsibility for their actions are insecure as\n\nto their abilities. I do not condemn Sweden for wanting something\n\nother than what I believe. And there are many Americans that\n\nbelieve we are heading in the wrong direction. Ask the Russians how\n\nwell Socialism has succeeded. Everyone equal means that only those\n\nwilling to work will provide for those who don't . Against human nature\n\nI think.\n09:47 November 8, 2012 by smilingjack\nThe part of the vote not reported was a big thumbs up for legalising cannabis! several states have legalised - YES LEGALISED cannabis use. Add to that a growing support for gay marriage in the USA and you get an idea that thosy crazy draconian old christians are losing power. As less people watch TV and can finally get the truth it was bound to happen! The yanks can try and brainwash kiddies into believing the world is flat and 5000 years old. That the yanks are all powerful and conquering and warm and fuzzy - but in the end the truth got out.\n\nA great step forward for america and for ending religious mumbo jumbo.\n10:30 November 8, 2012 by Old Stone\nOh my gosh!!! I had no idea I was narrow minded!!! Thank you for this informative article. Now what do I do?!??\n12:53 November 8, 2012 by Danne8\nNarrow-minded about politics? Well, let me tell you The Local, the narrow-mindedness does not just stop there...\n\nOh! and look! there's a new party that perhaps Americans can consider for the next elections: http://www.theswedishparty.org/\n16:02 November 8, 2012 by kenny8076\nwhat is wrong with peoples obsession that Healthcare and college in socialist country's is free?!?!\n\nCJ from Sunshine Desserts..... HEALTHCARE IS NOT FREE!!!!!! do you have ANY idea of the amount of taxes they pay here for their mediocre healthcare? the same system that continually has reports of ambulances not responding to 112 calls deemed not serious enough and the person dies!! people are incredible..... 25% sales tax...30-60% income tax. 12% tax on grocerys, tax on fuel (try $8.50) a gallon). There was a story on here the other day saying swedes (and me, albeit temporary) pay something like 70% of their monthly income on taxes, from everyday spending and income.......\n\nand dont get me started on their education.... people say its free.... Well in America we say \"you get what you pay for\"...... perhaps they should start actually paying for school, then maybe it could be competitive and worthwhile\n23:07 November 8, 2012 by Camlon\nSo Swedes are not narrow-minded? Most Americans are narrow-minded about politics AND most Swedes are narrow-minded about politics.\n04:37 November 9, 2012 by Billerica\nIt is difficult to compare America ,with over 300 million legal residents, not counting the 12 million or more illegals, to a population of 9 million Swedish residents. Our country is based on a constitution that supports a democracy. In Sweden, which I happen to love, you have socialism. It works for you but America was not based on socialistic principals. When our founding Fathers lead a revolution against England it was to reduce the control of government on the citizens. What is happening now is a reversal, more control less individual responciblity.\n07:17 November 9, 2012 by Bentham\n\nNo, Sweden isn't a socialist country and has never been. It's a *welfare* country built upon a market economy. Get your facts straight Yankee.\n\n\n\"Socialism (play /&#712;so&#650;&#643;&#601;l&#618;z&#601;m/) is an economic system characterised by social ownership of the means of production and co-operative management of the economy,[1] and a political philosophy advocating such a system. \"Social ownership\" may refer to cooperative enterprises, common ownership, state ownership, or citizen ownership of equity.\" End quote.\n\n07:38 November 9, 2012 by KossBoss\n\nPerhaps you should fix your own messed up public school system first before you post your bull? US spends most money in the world per student, and yet the nation sinks lower and lower in the international education rankings. Well, the dollar is weak so it makes sense I guess. So what do you get from your well funded high school students? A large bunch of illiterate dropouts who can't even point out Europe or Africa on a world map? Say, Yale next? So much for \"you get what you pay for\". You should be happy for the floods of well science educated Bulgarians, Russians and Asians who fill your ivy league unis. Without them you'd be nothing.\n11:22 November 9, 2012 by Bentham\n@Richard S\n\nAllright Richard. You forgot that you also once depended on all your socialist funded schools which prepared you for college or land your first job by flipping\n\nburgers at the local joint to make your first well earned bucks.. Right? ..\n\nSweden didn't get it's wealth from disregarding people's enterprise either so please to lump Sweden together with old Soviet which relied on a completely\n\ndifferent system. In fact, it was thanks to all the inventiveness and hard work which built up all the successful private companies, private investments in\n\nthe building of the railways, private donations to technical colleges such as Chalmers and KTH and the large private export sector that made the country to\n\nwhat it is today. You have to understand that Sweden's welfare model presupposes and is built upon a market economy, which means being dependant on private companies' revenues where people have an incitement to compete for the best paying jobs. That's far from socialism where *everything* is owned by the state or by a cooperative. So in reality, it doesn't encourage people to depend on the state as it would be impossible to live a decent life only on government\n\nhand outs. But in case you'd need it, it would make you survive, but not much more. People do however, get benefits such as healthcare, university education, childcare etc which everyone has already paid for through their taxes. Along with it there are also private options for healthcare, dental care and private schools which complete and unburden the regular state services. Some nights ago an American researcher in economy told in an interview that Americans in reality actually get less for the same amount spent on private healthcare in US than Swedes get through taxes in Sweden. In reality many Americans have to\n\nspend just as much or more on health insurances, childcare, schools etc as Swedes to live up to the same standard. The difference is that you can choose\n\nbetween many more options in the US and have the freedom if you want to pay or not. But having such a system presupposes that people have decently paid jobs. The essence of the American dream is that *everyone* can become rich through hard work, so in that way it's essence is equality as in the meaning of gaining a decent or rich life is possible for everyone as long as everyone is prepared to chip in. So good so far. Unfortunately one cannot control the world economy and therefore not choose\n\nto stay employed or have a steady income during rough times. It all depends on the state of the nation which system people prefer to suit them best. During\n\nrecession such as now in the US, I think it's no coincidence that the Americans have re-elected a democratic president a second time as people prioritize\n\nstability before anything else.\n11:29 November 9, 2012 by eppie\nIt is not strange europeans or others actually would en masse vote for Obama if they could. Not because he is so great, but just because he is not republican.\n\nVoting republican would be the same as saying you like the Taliban, or say you vote for Putin. The republican party is outdated, and it is time that the US start basing its politics on modern day life instead of on a few100 years old document from a time they were under attack by England and Indians.\n\nWe in Europe should however not forget that history is much different for us than for the US. When we started to build up our society based on science and humanism, all kinds of religious outcasts went to america to build up a life. They had to do everything themselves and start a country to protect themselves from Spanish, English, French and locals.\n\nI for one hope for change, and hope the GOP will start behaving like modern world citizens instead of just frustrating every Obama step into the modern world.\n19:02 November 9, 2012 by MarshaLynn\nIt is so ridiculous what liberals equate as modern and intelligent, whether they be American or European. It is intelligent and modern to them to give up your personal liberty and hand it over to a huge government that will take care of you cradle to grave. That is precisely what America was all about from the beginning, i.e., to have personal liberty, to chart your own course, to not be under the thumb of any government that lords it over you. The government was to be of the people by the people. That is certainly not true in Europe, and it is gradually becoming untrue in America.\n\nIn America we have hoardes of highly unintelligent ignorant people who just want free Obamaphones. That is as deep as their thinking processes go. Just give them free stuff and they will vote for you; then they return to their lives which are barely above the level of an animal. They can barely speak at all, just lots of guttural sounds strung together that apparently one another understand.\n\nThen there are the more educated liberals who operate on the level of feelings. If they feel a certain way, then that is their truth. These people are supposedly highly intelligent, yet they lack the capacity to see that trading personal liberty for physical comforts is a bad trade. They are the misguided ones, who operate strictly on the level of feelings and are unable to follow logical argument to the contrary.\n\nThe other issue is morality. Apparently morality is outdated with liberals. To them, you should just be free to engage in sex whenever with whatever. This is considered enlightened. Never mind that time shows, and will continue to show, that such behaviors are terrible for human beings. Destroys the family, leads to disease, other stuff. These people are narcissists. No point trying to reason with them. They too live barely above the animal level, though they appear oh so elite and oh so intelligent outwardly.\n\nI realize I am wasting my breath. Reap what you sow, liberals. Unfortunately, you force the rest of us to reap it with you.\n20:41 November 9, 2012 by sgbsse\nIt is funny that whenever something goes wrong people would be questioning \"why the government let this happen\" \"why is the government not helping?\" \"why is it not regulated\" And yet they do not want \"BIG\" government.\n\nMany Americans complain about the so call \"Obamacare\" how many actually sit down and go through the document item by item. Whatever you got from the campaigning Ad are mostly not true from both sides.\n\nCheck for the facts on FactCheck.org\n23:02 November 9, 2012 by bcterry\n@ MarshaLynn,\n\nRight on point, well said.\n03:50 November 10, 2012 by Eric1\nSwedish politics lacks diversity of ideals. It's all one version of socialism or another. Any other thoughts are prohibited.\n14:21 November 10, 2012 by useronthenet\nI think most Americans don't really have a choice do they, it's either Republicans or Democrats. In any event I don't think it will make much of a difference whoever gets in power. 14 trillion dollars in debt and rising. Massive unemployment. The only democratic country (and I use that terminology very loosly) that doesn't have a National health service for everyone regardless of their financial position (even Cubans get better health care than the average American) Unelected and undemocratic banking system ie: the Federal Reserve Bank (owned by an anonymous entity) which is paid an exstortionate amount of money by the US Government. I'm sure George Washington would be proud if he was alive today. Yep must be nice living in the land of the free (NOT),\n19:26 November 10, 2012 by bcterry\n\n\"Yep must be nice living in the land of the free (NOT), \"\n\nYet the Cubans, and millions of others from every corner of the planet are doing whatever they can to to get to America to live under those terrible conditions where there is no freedom.\n09:58 November 11, 2012 by Lavaux\nQuoting the inimitable Mark Steyn:\n\n\"In the course of his first term, Obama increased the federal debt by just shy of $6 trillion and in return grew the economy by $905 billion. So, as Lance Roberts at Street Talk Live pointed out, in order to generate every dollar of economic growth the United States had to borrow about five dollars and 60 cents. There's no one out there on the planet \u0097 whether it's \"the rich\" or the Chinese \u0097 who can afford to carry on bankrolling that rate of return. According to one CBO analysis, U.S.-government spending is sustainable as long as the rest of the world is prepared to sink 19 percent of its GDP into U.S. Treasury debt. We already know the answer to that: In order to avoid the public humiliation of a failed bond auction, the U.S. Treasury sells 70 percent of the debt it issues to the Federal Reserve \u0097 which is to say the left hand of the U.S. government is borrowing money from the right hand of the U.S. government.\"\n\nMark Steyn's comments are factual, i.e. stating facts. Yes, facts; remember what those are? You won't get facts from the Swedish media, who simply ape the American legacy media's supine worship of Obama and his regime.\n\nLet's recap Mr. Steyn's comments: For every $5.60 Obama borrowed and spent, he got $1 of GDP growth. Would you borrow 36 kr to get 7 kr back? If you would, how long could you do so before becoming insolvent?\n\nNext, will the rest of the world, including Sweden, spend 19% or even 6% of its GDP buying US Treasuries in order to bankroll America's expanding welfare state? Never gonna happen. Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Greece and Spain are out for sure.\n\nFinally, when the Federal Reserve (equivalent of Sveriges Riksbank) buys 70% of Obama's debt, what it's actually doing is printing money equivalent to 70% of Obama's debt, or approx. $4 trillion thus far. Would you lend money to a country that can repay you in printed money hot off the presses (this is known as \"monetizing debt\")? Of course not.\n\nIn view of the foregoing facts, one must conclude that there isn't enough money in all the world to bankroll Obama's America. But our Community Organizer in Chief does not believe this. After all, he began his career as a political extortionist, shaking down banks, insurance companies and city governments for unearned cash and benefits. Therefore it's safe to say that the Obama regime is not going to fix any of these problems. If not, America will collapse and probably drag Europe down with it, leaving Europe at the mercy of Russia and China.\n\nBet you haven't heard this from DN, SvD or SVT 1 or 2, huh? Get ready for a brave new world, folks.\n09:13 November 12, 2012 by entry\nStop wasting oxygen!\n\n10:34 November 12, 2012 by what would thomas paine do\nLavaux: \"Reason, blah, blah, Logic, blah, blah, Reason.\"\n\nSheeple: \"Logically, if Lavaux weighs the same as a duck, he's made of wood.

But they say that risk is smaller than the risk of letting Assad go unpunished.\n\n\u201cThis critical decision comes at a time when Iran is racing toward obtaining nuclear capability,\u201d AIPAC said in its statement. \u201cFailure to approve this resolution would weaken our country\u2019s credibility to prevent the use and proliferation of unconventional weapons and thereby greatly endanger our country\u2019s security and interests and those of our regional allies.\u201d\n\n\u201cAIPAC maintains that it is imperative to adopt the resolution to authorize the use of force and take a firm stand that the world\u2019s most dangerous regimes cannot obtain and use the most dangerous weapons,\u201d it said.\n\nThe Anti-Defamation League urged Congress to \u201cact swiftly to add its voice to hold (Assad) accountable for the wanton slaughter of his own citizens.\u201d\n\n\u201cAny nation that violates international norms and obligations which threaten the peace and security of the world must face the consequences of those dangerous acts,\u201d it said.\n\nIn making their case for military action to punish Syria for using chemical weapons, Obama and his aides have gone out of their way to court the support of the American Jews by drawing parallels between Syrian President Bashar Assad\u2019s use of poison gas and the gas chambers of Nazi Germany.\n\n\n\u201cBecause he refused to stand by, Wallenberg reminds us of our power when we choose not simply to bear witness, but also to act,\u201d Obama said.\n\n\nSecretary of State John Kerry has invoked the phrase \u201cnever again,\u201d a direct reference to international vows to prevent a repeat of the Holocaust, and even compared Assad to Adolf Hitler, something that even the pro-Israel groups backing the administration have shied away from, at least so far.\n\n\n\u201cI think Israel has a strong natural defense and I think they can do well in any battle. But I don\u2019t want to involve Israel in a battle because they have so many enemies around them that I\u2019m fearful it can spin out of control,\u201d Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., told Sean Hannity of Fox News last week.\n\n\nThey said they will continue to lobby in the days ahead \u2014 AIPAC is bringing some 250 pro-Israel activists to Washington next week to push for the authorization \u2014 but they have also told the White House that only a powerful and direct personal appeal from Obama himself is likely to have an impact.\n\n\u201cThe idea that the pro-Israel community is a magic wand that can make this vote happen is a conspiracy theory,\u201d said Josh Block, a former AIPAC spokesman who now heads The Israel Project. \u201cIt\u2019s not born out of reality.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut, certainly when supporters of the U.S.-Israel relationship and experts in the region who have real credibility join with the president and other voices in the foreign policy and human rights community, it matters,\u201d he said.\n\n\nMany of the president\u2019s Democratic supporters are deeply conflicted over the use of force.\n\n\nThis divide also is apparent among Israel-centric organizations.\n\n\n\u201cAs President Obama and world leaders contemplate the appropriate course of action, we are cognizant that there are no easy or clear-cut solutions,\u201d it said. \u201cAny action taken should aim to minimize the loss of civilian life, deter the further use of chemical weapons and avoid regional spillover.\u201d\n\nblog comments powered by Disqus"}

The two Catonsville residents were looking at a serving bowl at Twins Polish Pottery booth along Frederick Road Sunday. (Photo by Nate Pesce / September 9, 2012)\n\nWithout a Sunday Ravens game to prepare for, or threatening skies to cast a shadow on the festivities, the crowds came early for Sunday's 39th annual Catonsville Arts and Crafts Festival.\n\nLess than an hour after its official opening at 10 a.m., crowds had already begun to jam the stretch of Frederick Road between Ingleside Avenue and Melvin Avenue, enjoying the late summer weather and the opportunity to check out the variety of crafts, food and local institutions.\n\n\"You can't ask for a nicer day,\" said Del. James Malone, an Arbutus native who represents District 12B that includes Catonsville, Arbutus and Lansdowne, as he stopped between two of the more 200 booths that lined Catonsville's Main Street.\n\n\"It's so nice to walk up and down Frederick Road and seeing some people that maybe you only see once a year, who may not even live in Catonsville any more, who come back to walk up and down and see people and check out all the things that are going on,\" he said.\n\n\"Like\" explorebaltimorecounty's Facebook page\n\nThere was plenty to check out.\n\nThose hungry for a late breakfast, early lunch or just refreshment to fuel another pass down Frederick Road could sample food that was easy to eat and go from area eateries such as Catonsville Gourmet, Edible Arrangements, Ships Cafe, Taneytown Express, Regions and Peace a Pizza.\n\nThe Catonsville Sunday Farmers Market was also well represented on the parking lot behind Friendly's restaurant.\n\nIn addition to ready-made sandwiches, festival-goers could pick up fresh produce and baked items.\n\nThose looking for less commonplace items could check out a stand stocked with a variety of fresh garlic or another devoted to growing mushrooms.\n\n\"It is so wonderful for Catonsville to do this every year,\" said Teal Cary, executive director of the Greater Catonsville Chamber of Commerce which sponsors the annual festival.\n\n\"Our chamber booth has been packed,\" she said on the steady stream of visitors to the booth, many of whom walked away with a free gift bag that included a program, hand fan touting the chamber's summer concert series and a poster extolling Catonsville as \"Music City Maryland.\"\n\n\"We get terrific support from the community and the vendors tell us this is the best show they do all year,\" she said.\n\nNear the chamber's booth, a tented area with folding chairs offered a place to rest and enjoy live music by bands on the stage at Melvin Avenue.\n\nAnother stage at Egges Lane, the site of the chamber's Friday evening concerts, also gave visitors another place to rest and enjoy live music.\n\nA KidZone provided younger visitors a place to play, as did the cornhole toss game at a stand manned by student-athletes from the nearby University of Maryland, Baltimore County, campus.\n\nTony Alleyne said those of college age were not the only visitors to his Community College of Baltimore County booth.\n\n\"We get a lot of seniors who are thinking about getting involved with our continuing education series,\" said Alleyne, an admissions counselor at the school.\n\n\"This is a great opportunity to see the Catonsville community come out,\" said Alleyne, in his fifth year manning a stand for CCBC.\n\n\"We get a lot of grads from the 70s and 80s who come out, who still remember when it was CCC (Catonsville Community College), and still show the love,\" he said. \"It's a great opportunity to see the alumni.\"\n\nMixed in with the stands of more than 20 area nonprofits were vendors offering photographs, handmade jewelry, wooden crafts, scents, soaps and apparel items for people as well as their pets.\n\nAmong the more unique offerings was a stand offering pen flowers, wallets, lanyards, hair bows and other items made out of duct tape.\n\n\"Everybody has been pretty interested,\" said Christina Vaughn, the Arbutus Duct Tape Lady, in her first year at the festival.\n\nThe Halethorpe resident said she began her business about a year ago at the behest of her daughter, Serena, now 11.\n\nShe said when she heard the festival had one spot remaining for the Sept. 9 event, \"I said, 'Give it to me!' \"\n\nNear the KidZone, Chris Adair and Catonsville resident Scott Westcoat enjoyed the opportunity to open the doors to their Frederick Road bicycle shop that they plan to open in October.\n\n\"We're spreading the word, offering free bike check-ups, getting to know the community,\" said Adair, an Annapolis area resident who plans to commute to the shop on his bicycle.\n\n\"I love this community,\" he said. \"I come up here to ride a lot, to Ellicott City, Patapsco (Valley) State Park.\"\n\nFurther down Frederick Road, Holly Trevino was enjoying the foot traffic and visitors to her Twins Polish Pottery stand.\n\nShe said she has been coming to the festival for more than a decade to sell her blue and white stoneware.\n\n\"It's very family friendly. It brings a good crowd, even when it rains,\" said the Mt. Airy resident, referring to the downpours that plagued the festival several years ago.\n\n\"It's a lot of fun and we do well here. We have our regular customers,\" she said. \"The atmosphere, I enjoy it so much. It's like my day off. My husband's home with the kids and once I get set up, I really enjoy it.\n\n\"It's very family friendly,\" she said. \"I know it's outside (Washington) D.C., but it has this real small town feel to it.\""}

{"dataman_score": 4.0, "text": "Among real estate organizations today, there is a growing recognition of the importance of human capital. The proof is in the training budget.\n\nIn a recent Watson Wyatt Worldwide study, \"Competencies and the Competitive Edge,\" 70% of high-performing companies identified employee training and development as the driver of future corporate success.\n\nA 1998 industry report in Training magazine supports that conclusion, revealing that total dollars budgeted for formal training by U.S. organizations last year topped $60.7 billion. The majority of that training - 70% - was done in formal classroom settings.\n\nYet, increasingly, organizations are considering more alternative, high-tech options. For example, respondents estimated that 19% of all the formal training courses their organizations offered in 1998 was delivered via computer in some way, whether on CD-ROM, diskettes, online via the Internet, or online via the organization's internal Intranet. The remaining 11% of training is delivered through structured, on-the-job training, video, satellite teleconferencing and other methods.\n\nRecognizing the significant changes that are occurring in the real estate industry as they pertain to training property management staff, the Institute of Real Estate Management (IREM) gathered representatives from some of the industry's major firms to discuss the future of real estate education at its Corporate/Government Education Leadership Forum held in Dallas last August.\n\nAt the forum, the industry representatives addressed some of today's hot training trends, including blending corporate programs with off-the-shelf courses; customized courses; satellite education; client surveys to assess training needs; education for standardization of policies and procedures; external marketing as a tool to build internal teams; and measuring the value of education.\n\nParticipants at the IREM forum included representatives from AIMCO; Equity Residential Properties Trust; U.S. General Services Administration; Grubb & Ellis; HUD; Insignia/ESG; Neighborhood Reinvestment Corp.; Oakwood/R&B Realty Group; Prentiss Properties Ltd. Inc.; Presidio Investments Ltd.; Southern Management Corp.; Trammell Crow Co.; Transwestern Commercial Services LLC; Army Housing Division; and the U.S. Air Force.\n\nReal estate training has gone through several cycles within the last few decades. While the early part of the 1990s saw a reduction in training due to industry layoffs and downsizing, the decade is concluding with a resurgence in the need to offer quality training programs in a variety of formats.\n\nAs John Combs, CPM, president of U.S. property services for Insignia/ESG Inc., AMO, in Irvine, Calif., explains, today's real estate organizations want to make sure all of their employees are working from the same baseline of education and training.\n\n\"With the consolidation occurring in the industry,\" Combs says, \"we're seeing organizations assessing their training needs and developing strategic plans to implement targeted programs for employees.\"\n\nAs a result, many firms are turning to blended training where a real estate company will enter a joint venture with an industry group to teach a course using the company's own forms, procedures and operating policies.\n\n\"A graduate of a blended course offered and taught by IREM, for example, ends up being trained in the company's procedures but with the added benefit of earning CPM credentials,\" Combs explains. \"The quality of training goes way up that way.\"\n\nAs real estate companies move toward the millennium, they understand that any employee training must have a direct impact on the bottom line. Training with no real return will not work. To that end, organizations increasingly are trying to identify what areas of training are most important to the customer.\n\nCombs notes that Insignia/ESG has conducted 12,000 tenant perception studies and 400 property owner studies in which the client was asked what areas of service are most important to them as a way of targeting training topics for employees. The result of those studies was the development of WOW, a two-day customer service course for Insignia/ESG employees. The course focuses on both tenant and owner service needs.\n\n\"We borrow concepts in customer service delivery from the hospitality and retail industries,\" Combs says. \"We want to do a training curriculum that is driven by our clients' needs. We're selling service that has real value to the client.\"\n\nThe Insignia executive also suggests that real estate training is still in its infancy. Within the next 18 months, he anticipates that the industry will develop measurement tools to assess real returns on training dollars.\n\n\"It's no longer sufficient to use an evaluation form at the end of a training course as a measurement tool,\" he says. \"We need to develop real benchmarking tools to help us assess the effectiveness of our training and then implement incentive plans to reward employees for improvement.\"\n\nTraining is no longer a personal perk; it is a necessity of doing business and a formidable employee-retention tool. The methods of training will no longer be traditional, however. Increasingly, real estate education will go the way of technology - fast, flexible and customized. Corporate universities, Internet-based training programs and satellite conferencing are just a few of the new forms of training that real estate organizations will be using.\n\nAs Michael Lipsey, CPM, president of The Lipsey Co. in Longwood, Fla. , can attest, real estate management companies are willing to contract for quality education. Lipsey's company offers property-management training in a variety of formats, including classroom training, videotaped programs known as \"Lunch and Learns,\" live Internet-based training programs via its website (, and customized company-wide broadcasts on specific topics.\n\nPopular topics for training in today's real estate management market, according to Lipsey, include developing ancillary revenue sources, reducing service delivery time for tenants, presentation skills, negotiation training, and improving financial literacy.\n\n\"Companies today are recognizing that training is essential,\" Lipsey says. \"Training budgets are not being slashed as much as they used to.\"\n\nMoreover, Lipsey says that today's real estate organization is more likely to offer a mixed-bag training approach, using every medium available to them, including home study, Internet, video, and customized education programs.\n\n\"In today's merger and acquisition climate, real estate companies have to train everyone with the same best practices,\" he explains. \"Training is only one way today to build an esprit de corps, to improve morale and to understand what you have to do as a company to be successful.\"\n\nFocus groups, skill audits and client surveys are all among the ways that management companies are identifying training needs. Any real estate training program of the future will need to involve measurement and justification of the return on the cost of training.\n\nREITs and companies that self-manage are particularly aggressive in training employees. As Lipsey discloses, \"We're finding that some of these companies are really enlightened when it comes to training, are improving skill sets and providing better service.\"\n\nCompanies such as Gale & Wentworth LLC, Jones Lang LaSalle and Trammell Crow have made a real commitment to invest in their employees' training.\n\n\"The management firms that invest in training and technology will have greater market share,\" notes Lipsey. \"When you make an investment in your people and your systems, you are helping to ensure better customer retention.\""}

I remember using my iPhone for exactly 45 minutes on a week away at Whistler, BC, and receiving a text message from AT&T when I returned to call them immediately to deal with an excessive charge.\n\nAt least they are aware of the exorbitant fees. I will admit, which is difficult because I generally hate their coverage, that AT&T was on top of it, helping me to retroactively adjust my plan to reduce my $350 data usage\u2026that was QUITE the 45 minutes, I\u2019ll tell you. (hint: don\u2019t use Google maps while roaming internationally)\n\nThis time around, I had learned my lesson, and called in advance to sign up for the International calling, text and data plans. $5.99 allowed me to reduce my calls to $2/minute, instead of $4/minute. Needless to say, I wasn\u2019t chatting aimlessly with my son at that rate. Speed-talking was the name of the game, with a sharp eye on time elapsed.\n\nI also bought 50 text messages for $10, which was a deal. I used this feature a lot, including sending photos to friends and family.\n\nFinally, I bought the $59.99 data package, which included 50MB of data. What does 50MB even MEAN? It\u2019s like a billion dollars\u2026I have no reference point, so I can\u2019t imagine what it\u2019s worth. I decided to go with this package, which was the medium-sized one, after being reassured I could retroactively change the plans to suit my usage when I returned. Thank god.\n\nThe first few days of the trip in Ibarra, Ecuador, there was free wi-fi available, which uses none of my allotted data, so all was well. However, on the second week, with no wi-fi to be found, I turned on the data on my iPhone and I immediately regretted it. I went from 16 MB to 129 MB instantly!! With a 60 MB overcharge at $10/MB\u2026.ummmm\u2026yeah, you get the picture.\n\nI called Rachel at the AT&T Customer Service line today, and after many holds and calculations, she retroactively changed my plans to adjust to my usage, and while NOT inexpensive, she saved me around $600. Whew.\n\nSo, while I still drop calls all over Seattle, and am forced to use my Verizon cellphone when out of major metropolitan areas, I will say that AT&Ts customer service is pretty darned helpful.\n\nFollow me on Twitter @ImSassyCityGirl\n\nCategories: SassyBusiness\nMichele Costanza\n\nComments are closed."}

Bush \"strongly\" urges Utahns to elect Huntsman.\n\nKarras' campaign spokesman said the endorsement ad is just another example of the Huntsmans' elitist tendencies.\n\nWhile Huntsman's campaign will be spending more than $100,000 on the new Bush spot (now running in combination with a 30-second TV ad on Huntsman's education/economic development ideas), Karras is not running a new TV ad yet.\n\nSeveral new Karras TV and radio ads are scheduled for this week, said campaign manager Steve Starks. Older TV and radio ads were running last week.\n\n\"They have resources we don't have,\" Starks said of the Huntsman family. \"But we'll have a new TV ad\" running Tuesday.\n\nThat ad shows Karras on a school bus talking about his education plan.\n\n\"We have a fairly aggressive buy, but nowhere near $100,000,\" Starks said.\n\nThe Bush TV ad clearly is in response to Karras' continued criticism \u2014 albeit indirect \u2014 of Huntsman's pedigree and wealth. A new Karras billboard's tag line reads \"experience money can't buy.\"\n\nHuntsman is one of Utah's wealthiest individuals, coming from the philanthropic/billionaire family of Jon Huntsman Sr.\n\nThe new TV ad has Huntsman Jr. saying that not all the work he's done for Huntsman Chemical, the family's chemical firm, or even the Huntsman Cancer Foundation can replace his family and the need he sees for securing the future of Utah's children.\n\nBush then comes on to praise Huntsman Jr.'s service in the Reagan/Bush administration, \"my administration\" and for the \"current president\" \u2014 who is, of course, the unnamed President George W. Bush. (Huntsman Jr. worked as a White House aide for Ronald Reagan, ambassador to Singapore for George H.W. Bush and as a trade ambassador for the current President Bush.)\n\nBesides touting Huntsman Jr.'s business and government experience, Bush also doesn't call him Huntsman Jr. \u2014 Bush just calls him \"Jon Huntsman,\" perhaps an attempt to distance Huntsman Jr. from his well-to-do father.\n\nIn a final match-up between a Democrat and Republican, it is not unusual for a sitting GOP president to cut an ad for a Utah candidate. Reagan himself came to Utah in 1982 to give Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, a boost when he was challenged by the then-popular Salt Lake City Mayor Ted Wilson.\n\n\"Yeah, the Gipper came in four days before that election\" and the popular Reagan's endorsement and appearance with Hatch \"made my political life move before my eyes,\" Wilson recalled Monday. Hatch handily defeated Wilson that year.\n\n\"But you have to say that an endorsement by the former President G.H.W. Bush, who is well-liked by all Utahns, is a biggie \u2014 very significant for Huntsman,\" Wilson said.\n\nWilson said to get such an endorsement just before a primary is especially helpful.\n\nStarks said he finds it surprising that the former president would endorse Huntsman Jr. \"considering what his dad, Jon Huntsman Sr., said about his son's administration.\"\n\nGet The Deseret News Everywhere"}

And I am still having trouble with it today (more of the Probability than the Statistics), on the FE/EIT Exam, which I have just taken my 3rd attempt at 2 weekends ago. I remember the 95% confident interval, sample mean, sample variance, standard deviation, & etc. So yes, u are right that if selected properly, the sample size would be enough.\n\nI was just trying to point out that RIAA/MPAA with their draconian methods, will file lawsuit over the smallest infractions aka 12 songs being shared or one small study proving that they are wrong about filesharers/pirates.\n\n"}

Now, the micro-blogging service is finally doing something about it. Twitter is beefing up its security with a voluntary, opt-in two-step authentication system in hopes of putting an end to much of the drama.\n\n\"Every day, a growing number of people log in to Twitter. Usually these login attempts come from the genuine account owners, but we occasionally hear from people whose accounts have been compromised by email phishing schemes or a breach of password data elsewhere on the web,\" says Jim O'Leary of the product security team at Twitter. \"Today we're introducing a new security feature to better protect your Twitter account: login verification.\"\n\n\nA Painful Process?\n\nTwitter is responding to recent attacks against news agencies by the Syrian Electronic Army, a \"hacktivist\" group that supports Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. The Financial Times was the latest victim. Twelve posts entitled \"Hacked by the Syrian Electronic Army\" appeared on the FT's tech blog between 12:38 p.m. and 12:42 p.m. London time last Friday, May 17th, with the company's Twitter accounts also disrupted, the Financial Times said. The Guardian, a UK news site, as well as the Associated Press and others have also been attacked.\n\n\"With login verification enabled, your existing applications will continue to work without disruption,\" O'Leary said. \"If you need to sign in to your Twitter account on other devices or apps, visit your applications page to generate a temporary password to log in and authorize that application.\"\n\nO'Leary goes on to describe the login verification as a two-form factor authentication. Here's how it works: When you sign into Twitter.com, there's a second check to make sure it's really you. Specifically, you'll be asked to register a verified phone number and a confirmed e-mail address. After you enroll in login verification, you'll be asked to enter a six-digit code that Twitter sends to your phone via SMS each time you sign in to Twitter.com.\n\nTwitter Plays Catch Up\n\nThe general consensus in the security community is \"good job, Twitter.\" We asked Ken Pickering, a development manager in the Security Intelligence at CORE Security, to elaborate on the sentiment from security experts. He told us this is a big and overdue step by Twitter towards being more secure, but it's only half the battle.\n\n\"A successful attacker would now need access to your password and your cell phone instead of basic password cracking software, but the hard part is convincing people to use it,\" Pickering said.\n\n\"Google and Facebook have been using two-factor authentication for a while and I have yet to see widespread adoption. If you care at all about the security of these social networks, you should be using two-factor authentication. As long as everyone does, we'll be in a much better position.\"\n\nTell Us What You Think\n\n\nLike Us on FacebookFollow Us on Twitter\n"}

Changeable conditions throughout the weekend made both races challenging. In Race 1 the car crossed the line eighth in class, the Evora working well in the wet. Sunday\u2019s Race 2 was damp at the start but the teams went with slicks anyway. Team leader Johnny Mowlem spun at Turn 2, dropping to 26th, but his recovery was brilliant. By changeover time in the 37 lap race he was fifth in Super GT and on course for a strong finish. However, team-mate Marcello Puglisi earned a drive-thru penalty for speeding and, as he rejoined the track, clipped a Ferrari and damaged the front-right suspension. This lost the Italian team four laps, dropping them down the order.\n\nPortugal\u2019s Goodsense Racing Team contested the GT Light class with their Evora GT4. Angela Negrao and Joffrey Didier qualified for Race 1 2nd in their class but failed to finish when a wheel nut came lose on Lap 10 after Didier\u2019s pitstop for slicks. For Race 2, the team qualified 3rd and maintained this position to the end, reaching the podium and setting the fastest GT Light lap in the process.\n\nJohnny Mowlem (Lotus Giudici Racing): \u201cThe International GT Open is probably the most competitive GT championship there is. Given this was the first time the team had seen the car, we\u2019d not been to this track before and it was our first time on Dunlops I didn\u2019t hold out much hope for a result. I was therefore pleasantly surprised by the car\u2019s performance. Starting the second race in the damp and on slicks was great, the Lotus loves that. We were on course for a storming finish, coming from the back up to fifth place. In the wet we were able to match the pace of everyone except the top three. The car handles beautifully, it\u2019s just lacking aero and development. We\u2019ll work on it, but I left Portugal feeling encouraged.\u201d"}

They say that it is 111 octane rating. Will it hurt the hoses\n  \u2022 no body want to chime in on this one so, Yes it will run on E85 gas but not sure of the ?? of will it harm the hoses, a rubber hose guy says \"that the hose shuld be fine but that some of the O rings may degrade over time and leak. If you use it keep real good track of anything with a O ring for leakage\"\n  \u2022 lou89lou89 Posts: 27\n    I would not use E85 unless your 2000 is stipulated as a FLEX FUEL VEHICLE BY THE MANUFACTURER. Gasoline sold commonly is E10 and is safe for older cars. Otherwise, costly damage can result. E10 is 10% ethanol-90% gasoline. Forget the octane claimed. E fuel is less efficient than pure gasoline. Tests(CA) by Edmonds on a 2007 Flex Fuel Tahoe indicated 20 t0 26 % less efficient miles per gallon.(google \" thanol fuel \"; for other links as well. Fewer MPG and thus more costly per mile of vehicle operation. The 667 miles tests resulted in a 36,5 gal reg gas use ( 18.3 mpg) and E85 required 50 gal(13.5mpg), $30 more fuel cost. They computed the carbon effect with gasoline @706 lbs., E85 @703.1 which rreally a tie; a scant o.5% difference. Also go, I believe it is. I do not think you Catera is RATED FLEX FUEL by GM, check the manual or Dealer.Donor use E85 in your fuel system. Ethanol is a solvent whic will destroy components not yet engineered by mfr to wirhstand E85.\n  \u2022 YA thats what every body says. the MPG I cant find as my speedometer is currently not working but it does run hotter at the cats. e85 does not have as many BTU's as gasoline does. The chemist f rends I have say the fuel lines may not be rated for this to go though them. It also doesn't start well in cold weather. dont have much invested in the car. The fuel line probliom may br solved soon with some help from my chemist friends and some sort of braded and lined hose. the injectors and seals are a problim yet to be thought out. Im guessing that the O2 sensors are going nuts trying to read the ourput they are geting also. I havent got a meter on the temps or the O2 reading yet to see how much differnt it is from gas eather\n  \u2022 lou89lou89 Posts: 27\n    Curious as to how many tank fillups you did with F 85 fuel.\n  \u2022 ybscorpybscorp Posts: 5\n    edited January 2012\n    about three weeks ago i did a complete from empty fill up and ran till it was empty. i have done three E10 fill ups since then and was running fl gas that was around E10 for about 10 fill up before that. I then did about 4 fill ups of Fl E10 gas and filled it up from empty. It got to about 38 deg and the thing would barely start. I got it to start and the only way it would stay running was to keep the rpms to about 2k till the heat gage started to move then it settled down and ran fine, at that point I started puting in 1/4 th tank of E10 at a time for about 4 times. It has been runing E10 fl gas ever since.\n    I didnt find the link they sent but there is a intersting comment at about its use in an Mg with carbs and problims it may have. It also give a link to site: that says page no longer found\n  \u2022 lou89lou89 Posts: 27\n    Ethanol is a solvent and can destroy fuel lines and O rings that are not yet engineered by GM to tolerate E85. Also, ethanol absorbs water and if the vehicle is not driven regularly, the ethanol and water can separate with the water settling to the bottom of your gas tank and accumulating in the fuel filter, suggesting that you probably should replace the fuel filter and drain any water from the tqnk. If those two conditions are present, your starting and rough running problems can occur. If you used e83 long enough to break down a fuel hose, etc, there could be that reidue in the fuel filter and tank. Call gasoline distributor(s) in your area to see if they have an outlet for non ethanol fuel that you could use for a while in your car, is another thought. I wish you well, I know this situation is frustrating; a real pain in your get along.\n  \u2022 the original posting is from 2007, but hope this can help others out.\n\n    if the battery dies or is replaced, the sunroof switch doesn't work unless it is reset by depressing it for 5 seconds. i found this out by reading the owners manual.\n  \u2022 Mechanic says it is the high side a/c pipe with muffler and port for charging.

{"dataman_score": 4.0, "text": "Small Business Sentiment: Contraction after Three Months of Slow Growth\n\n  \u2022 Print\n\nThe latest issue of the NFIB Small Business Economic Trends is out today (see report). The April update for March came in at 89.5, which puts it deep in the cellar at the 9th percentile in this series, where a distinctly recessionary mood prevails.\n\nHere is the opening summary of the report:\n\nAfter three months of sustained growth, the March NFIB Index of Small Business Optimism ended its slow climb, declining 1.3 points and landing at 89.5. In the 44 months of economic expansion since the beginning of the recovery in July 2009, the Index has averaged 90.7, putting the March reading below the mean for this period. Of the ten Index components, two increased, two were unchanged and six declined. Among the greatest declines were labor market indicators, inventory investment plans and sales expectations.\n\n\n\nClick to View\n\n\nClick to View\n\nInventories And Sales\n\n\nThe net percent of all owners (seasonally adjusted) reporting higher nominal sales over the past three months was negative 7 percent, an improvement of 2 points and the best reading in eight months. However, firms are still reporting more declines than gains. Such a negative outlook will not stimulate a lot of hiring or spending or inventory investment. The net percent of owners expecting higher real sales volumes fell 5 points to a negative 4 percent of all owners (seasonally adjusted), 16 points below the 2012 cycle high of a net 12 percent reached in February 2012. Seventeen (17) percent of small employers cite weak sales as their top business problem, a one point improvement over February.\n\nCredit Markets\n\n\nCredit demands remained weak in March. Twenty-nine (29) percent reported all credit needs met, and 49 percent explicitly said they did not want a loan (64 percent including those who did not answer the question, presumably uninterested in borrowing as well). Seven percent of owners surveyed reported that all their credit needs were not met, unchanged from February and 3 points above the record low.\n\nNFIB Commentary\n\nThis month's \"Commentary\" section offers a context for the March decline after three months of slow growth:\n\nSmall business produces half the private GDP and employs half the private sector workforce. But it is not growing, not hiring, not borrowing and not expanding enough. Small business owners have been depressed since 2007 and that has not changed. In the March survey of NFIB\u2019s 350,000 member firms, 77% expect the economy to be no better or even worse 6 months from now that it is currently. Only 4% think the current period is a good time to expand substantially, compared to an average of 17% for the period 1973 to 2007. More owners plan to reduce employment in the coming months than plan to create new jobs. More owners plan to reduce their inventories than plan to order new stocks. The bulk of growth comes from the increase in our population of about 3 million people and the growing need to simply replace stuff that is wearing out, not enough to get the economy back to trend growth much less the strong growth needed to restore employment to 2007 levels.\n\nBusiness Optimism and Consumer Confidence\n\n\nClick to View\n\nWith the latest NFIB data, we continue to see that the mood of small businesses is highly correlated with Consumer Confidence.\n\nSource: Advisor Perspectives\n\n\nAbout Doug Short"}

He threw for more than 4,200 yards, 25 TDs and was named to his first Pro Bowl.\n\nThen something happened.\n\nDuring the offseason, there were murmurs of a three-team trade that involved Cutler being dealt to either Detroit or Tampa Bay, with Denver receiving Matt Cassel, who then-new head coach Josh McDaniels had worked with the previous season in New England.\n\nEven though the Broncos made it clear that they were just rumors with\u00a0McDaniels saying,\u00a0\"We don't want to trade Jay...He's our quarterback,\"\u00a0Cutler just wouldn't let it go.\n\nHe would eventually demand a trade, which he would be granted. He was dealt to Chicago for Kyle Orton, two first-round picks and a third-round pick.\n\nNow, let's fast forward to today.\n\nNFL schedules have just been released, and the Chicago Bears will be visiting the Denver Broncos in Week 14.\n\nNow, that should be one hell of a scene.\n\nBroncos fans these days absolutely despise Jay Cutler; they feel he quit on them and acted like a baby (and that wasn't the last time people said that about him).\n\nSo you better believe there's going to be some serious fireworks when he returns to the house that Tim Tebow now owns.\n\nWith that being said, the Broncos' defense is still absolutely dreadful, and even if they pick up Marcell Dareus in the draft, Cutler and the Bears' offense should light it up against this motivated Broncos squad.\n\nThis isn't exactly Favre vs. the Packers, but it should make for some quality television.\n\nLoad More Stories\n\nFollow Denver Broncos from B/R on Facebook\n\n\nOut of Bounds\n\nDenver Broncos\n\nSubscribe Now\n\nWe will never share your email address\n\nThanks for signing up."}

A spectrum can't exist without endpoints to define it, but is there truly nothing in the middle?\n\n    Also, you are in fact saying that free speech (vis-a-vis anonymity) should in fact be allowed to protect illegal activity. If people cannot be tied back to their harmful actions, that is de facto protection.\n\n  \u2022 Oct 15th, 2012 @ 7:23pm\n\n    Re: Comparison to outting gays and lesbians\n\n    If you do not think it's OK to kidnap someone and lock them in the basement, how is that any different from putting someone in prison?\n\n    If you do not think it's OK to force someone to give you large sums of money, how is that any different from imposing a fine?\n\n    If you do not think it's OK to force someone to do unpaid labor, how is that any different from a community service requirement?\n\n    All of these are tools used by societies to punish those who would do harm to others; in so doing, they enforce social order. This form of doxxing is no different. To compare it to outing a closeted person is a gross false equivalency.\n\n  \u2022 Oct 15th, 2012 @ 7:16pm\n\n\n    I'm not the one giving the just outing of this the imprimatur of \"ethics\". I merely said there was nothing ethically wrong with it, in contrast to your assertion that it is ethically wrong to force him to face the consequences of his acts.\n\n    This is not a free speech issue. The actions of creepshots amounted to invasion of privacy at the absolute least, and arguments could be made for charges as serious as harassment and stalking. Free speech should be absolute, but doesn't mean it should shield someone from the consequences of other crimes they commit by doing so.\n\n    Will this person's life be ruined? Not by a long shot, though he will probably be inconvenienced for a time. The thing about doxxing is that the consequences one faces are determined entirely by the actions that doxxing ties to them. No one cares when a garden-variety troll gets doxxed, and even the more spectacular examples get written off quickly: it takes something truly egregious, as this case is, for there to be any truly major or lasting effects. The harm to his life is entirely self-inflicted: he could not deserve it more.\n\n  \u2022 Oct 15th, 2012 @ 1:40pm\n\n    Re: Moral reasoning can be a tricky thing\n\n    Frontier justice should indeed be left to the frontier, but in this particular sense the Internet is a frontier. It cannot be policed in any practical way by the centralized authorities that are typically responsible for this sort of thing in the real world, and so the frontier model is appropriate.\n\n    This is a case of someone who has abused his anonymity to harm people without facing the consequences. The appropriate punishment is for the anonymity he has shown he cannot be trusted with to be taken away from him -in a word, to be doxxed- and to face the consequences he had hoped to avoid: the things that happen in the real world to people who do what he did.

At our Clergy Conference, held in a spirit of brotherly love, His Eminence Metropolitan Laurus heard the entire scope of opinions on the present process of reconciliation of our Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia with the Moscow Patriarchate. From the discussions of this topic, it is apparent that there are various points of view on this matter within our Diocese. Despite this, by the end of our discussion, the clergy unanimously expressed the willingness to be obedient to the forthcoming Council of Bishops. We cannot predict its final results. For this reason, we call upon our flock to pray in earnest to our Heavenly Father, so that His will alone be done. May our prayers be righted as spiritual incense, and may the Lord send down upon us Divine Grace and the Gift of the Holy Spirit.\n\nWe express our heartfelt thanks to our merciful father and First Hierarch, His Eminence Metropolitan Laurus, and His Grace Bishop Gabriel for their wise leadership of our Diocese and their fatherly care for us.\n\nWe raise our prayers of thanks to God, who allowed us to meet, to pray together and commune of Christ's Holy Mysteries on this feast day of the Holy Martyrs of Sebaste.\n\nThe Participants of the Conference."}

I don\u2019t have enough room here to write about his remarkable life.\n\nI was taking pictures one night at Daniel Park - looking at the beautiful Christmas lights - and I was thinking of years past when I would go around and take pictures of the Chamber\u2019s picks for Christmas lighting. I would have my camera, tri-pod, hot chocolate, big coat, gloves and somewhat dreading it because it was always really cold - as I remember. Anyway, I don\u2019t do that so much anymore and even though I still need to use a tri-pod when taking night Christmas light shots - I haven\u2019t been doing it. But thinking about the years past made me realize, once again, how much things have changed. I\u2019m not sure if the Chamber still does the Christmas lighting contest anymore. \u00a0And there has been so much change with cameras that it is pretty different - same concept - but the equipment is very different. It\u2019s faster and thank goodness you don\u2019t have to use a darkroom anymore. That saves hours and hours.\n\nBut on to what we\u2019ve all been through weatherwise. Last Thursday night we had freezing rain and sleet - mostly sleet, thank goodness. AND no power outages around here. That was what I was worried about. So, Friday, school was out, businesses closed and then Saturday night the Chamber parade was postponed to this coming Saturday, Dec. 14th. We had more freezing rain and sleet Saturday night but it wasn\u2019t too bad. But school was out Monday and Tuesday. The temps have been in the 20\u2019s and low 30\u2019s so not much melting. It\u2019s been bad but it could have been terrible if we\u2019d lost power. Thank you, Lord, for letting us keep our power. My cats don\u2019t do well without heat when it\u2019s so cold. I guess I need to look into getting a portable generator.\n\nHope you are having a good week.\n\nGo to your happy (warm) place!\n\nSee you next week (or at the parade Saturday night)."}

The tale of how SpyEye -- the tool of choice for hackers who routinely pilfer from online bank accounts -- overtook the pioneering banking Trojan ZeuS could fit in any textbook on entrepreneurship. What's more, it show how business-like and resilient the world of criminal hacking has become.\n\nThe cyberunderground paused [to note] that Aleksandr Andreevich Panin, aka \"Gribodemon,\" had pleaded guilty to charges pegging him as the mastermind of SpyEye.\n\nSpyEye is the tool of choice for hackers who routinely pilfer from online bank accounts. It arose in 2009 as a cheaper imitation of the pioneering banking Trojan, ZeuS, which was the creation of a brilliant, young Russian programmer who goes by the aliases Slavik, A-Z, Umbro and Monstr.\n\nZeuS' creator remains on the loose.\n\nThe tale of how SpyEye overtook ZeuS could fit in any textbook on entrepreneurship. What's more, it demonstrates how business-like and resilient the world of criminal hacking has become.\n\nLet's pick up the story circa 2009, with the help of Don Jackson, director of threat intelligence at security start-up PhishLabs, and Loucif Kharouni, researcher at anti-malware firm Trend Micro.\n\nZeuS is selling for as much as $8,000 to crime gangs expert at hijacking online bank accounts. ZeuS hacks require customized tuning of the attack code, and crews of hackers working in concert to pull off Ocean's Eleven-like heists.\n\nAlong comes SpyEye, a lean and modular banking Trojan selling for around $1,000. \"While ZeuS was the infrastructure software for elite cybercrime crew operations, SpyEye became ZeuS for the masses,\" says Jackson.\n\nBanking Trojans infect Internet-connected computers and give the attacker full control. Early versions of SpyEye even included a command to seek out and uninstall any previous ZeuS infection.\n\nZeuS' creator, Slavik, initially professed to be nonplused by the competition. \"Slavik knew his software was great,\" Kharouni says. \"It was well coded, and he had good, loyal customers.\"\n\nAfter building a following, Gribodemon announced SpyEye would no longer uninstall ZeuS. \"He realized it would be better for him to be seen as a straight up competitor,\" Kharouni says.\n\nIf Gribodemon was bold, Slavik was cautious. A deal was struck. Slavik gave Gribodemon ZeuS' customers and access to ZeuS' top secret source code.\n\n\"(Slavik) was relieved of commitments to support the small-time ZeuS operators while keeping his reputation intact,\" Jackson says. \"The SpyEye author was handed ZeuS customers on a silver platter, backed by nothing less than an endorsement by the king of modern crimeware.\"\n\nKharouni believes Slavik sensed law enforcement closing in. \"He realized it would probably be best for him to give his source code to Gribodemon and make a lot of noise around that, so people would say, 'He's taking his retirement and we won't hear from him again,'\" Kharouni says.\n\nIn May 2011, Gribodemon's monopoly sustained a fracture. Someone leaked a copy of ZeuS' source code onto public forums, making it possible for any low-skilled programmer to create free versions of ZeuS or SpyEye.\n\nWas it Slavik, who's believed to be in his late 20s?\n\nAnd what's become of Slavik? Did he have a hand in creating the memory-parsing malware used to breach customer data?\n\n\"Did Slavik really retire for good? No, I don't think so,\" Kharouni says. \"He probably just moved on to another project, changed his identity and started something new.\"\n\nJackson concurs: \"I believe Slavik is still developing custom code for his top-tier clients of ZeuS.\"\n\n\u00a9 2014 USA TODAY under contract with YellowBrix.

The move by the JUI is just the latest episode in the ongoing and increasingly deadly persecution of Christians in that Islamic nation.\n\nAccording to JUI leader Maulana Abdul Rauf Farooqi, the Bible contains passages that show biblical figures whom Muslims regard as prophets (such as Abraham and Solomon) to be engaging in \u201ca variety of moral crimes.\u201d As such, the JUI has called on Pakistan\u2019s supreme court to have the entire Book banned from the country if the offending passages are not removed.\n\nI suppose the fact that the Old Testament predates the Q'ran by about a thousand years is irrelevant to these dickheads.\n\n(Interestingly, the JUI admitted that their petition was partly prompted by that Q'ran burning in Florida a few months back. With any luck, this will keep escalating until all the holy books in the world have been either banned or burned.)\n\nFull story\n\n\n\nTags: Bible, Christian, Islam, Muslim, Pakistan, blasphemy\n\nViews: 25\n\nReplies to This Discussion\n\nOh, and in case you're interested in discovering what immoral crimes Abraham and Solomon are said to have committed, you'll have to look it up yourself - I can't be arsed.

It says exactly what I beleive, have all religions attack each other as none listen to atheists. We are the only ethical, open minded people on the planet. If each religion squabbles with each other their incredible intolerance, bigotry, and totally insane beliefs can be viewed by all.\nI often recommend www.religioustolerance.org to believers (and non-), as a site that attempts to report fairly on different belief systems and their intersection with high-profile political and social issues. While not attacking people for their beliefs, the authors give no free passes for the harmful effects of actions motivated by religion. Things such as oppression of women, or special rights for heterosexuals, are called exactly that. Actions are judged by their objective effect on humans' freedom and well-being.\nReligions attacking each other is never a good idea. It's never the priests who do the fighting. Some of the older buildings in England, where religions *did* fight until a few centuries back, still have the spikes where they would display people's heads for owning Bibles in the wrong language.\nI blame it on globalisation. \u00a0They'll all need to converge into one religion that works for them all - with one holy book they can agree on. \u00a0You'll always have your splinter groups though... \u00a0:)\n\n...one holy book they can agree on...\n\nThe Orange Catholic Bible, anyone? :)\n\nLooks good.... :)\nDidn't the Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers do that once?\n\n\nSupport Atheist Nexus\n\nDonate Today\n\n\n\nHelp Nexus When You Buy From Amazon\n\n\n\n\nBadges \u00a0|\u00a0 Report an Issue \u00a0|\u00a0 Terms of Service"}

Lay\nMemorial Award[1]\n\nHoward S. Rich, also Howie Rich (b. 1940) is a Manhattan-based real estate investor who is notable for funding libertarian-oriented political initiatives such as term limits, school choice, parental rights regarding education, limited government and property rights.[2] He has published essays advocating these positions. He established advocacy organizations such as Americans for Limited Government and U.S. Term Limits.[3] He is currently the chairman of several organizations including Legislative Education Action Drive and the Parents in Charge Foundation. Rich has been described as one of the \"lower-profile moneymen in American politics\"[4] but as a prominent \"force in elections across the country.\"[5] Rich focuses his advocacy mostly on local issues like term limits, not on national campaigns, and doesn't see himself as leaning right or left.[5] He is an effective advocate; National Public Radio identified Rich as a leader behind the independent groups with potential to influence elections.[6]\n\nEarly years[edit]\n\nRich attended the George W. Wingate High School in Brooklyn, New York. While a senior, he earned the New York State Regents scholarship. He studied economics at Baruch College in New York City. He studied investing at the New York University Stern School of Business. According to one source, Rich initially had a plumbing contracting business, but used its revenues to buy real estate.[7] He became a real estate entrepreneur around 1965.[1] He began a pattern of buying Manhattan properties, fixing them up, and selling them. In 1970, he bought a multiresidential building. During the next two decades he bought more buildings and modernized them. Rich described his real estate strategy: \"I bought buildings when no one else wanted them, then I sold them.\"[5] By 1986 he owned 17 buildings but sold 15 buildings. After the 1987 stock market crash he sold one more building. In 1989 he exchanged his remaining property for a property in Houston. In the 1990s he began purchasing Manhattan properties again. In the 2000s, he sold some Manhattan properties and bought garden apartment developments in different states.[8]\n\nPolitical activism[edit]\n\nLibertarian beginnings[edit]\n\nBefore 1983, Rich was active in the Libertarian Party and worked with Charles Koch to promote small-government and free-market causes.[2] After 1983, Rich left the Libertarian Party and continued his activism with private groups.[2] In 1990, Rich and his wife Andrea took over the Libertarian Review Foundation, and renamed it the Center for Independent Thought.[2] Rich's wife was an owner of Laissez-Faire Books and was a trustee of the Atlas Economic Research Foundation.[7] While Rich has supported the Libertarian Party, he is enrolled as a Republican.[5]\n\nCato Institute[edit]\n\nRich serves on the Board of Directors of the Cato Institute.[9]\n\nNon-partisan activism[edit]\n\nIn 1992, Rich met Bill Wilson and the two worked together on a variety of causes.[10] Rich financed Wilson\u2019s efforts at U.S. Term Limits, Parents in Charge and Americans for Limited Government.[3][10] Rich's associate Wilson describes these organizations not as libertarian but rather as \"rolling back the government.\"[10] Rich explained his mission was to \"advance individual freedom and create an atmosphere where we restore the Founders' concepts of property rights and free markets.\"[7] Rich became more politically active in the movement to limit government beginning about 1992.[1] He has supported referendum measures that would limit government spending, curb the seizure of land and offer school vouchers.[5] He prefers underwriting ballot measures rather than lobbying in state capitols.[7] Rich explained: \"Working with the state legislators is a fool\u2019s errand\" and added \"Most of them are RINOs (Republicans in Name Only) who water things down to nothing.\"[7]\n\nAmericans for Limited Government[edit]\n\nRich has been a key financial supporter of Americans for Limited Government which was headed by Bill Wilson.[4][6][10] In 2009 it had a budget of $4 million.[10] This group has been described as non-partisan.[10] It has been critical of president Obama.[10] Wilson was quoted as saying \"It isn\u2019t one issue \u2013 health care, or cap and trade, or one or another appointee ... It\u2019s that government consumes more and more of what we call personal liberty.\"[10] The organization has also criticized former president Bush for \"egregious federal power-grabs\" regarding the USA Patriot Act, No Child Left Behind and Medicare.[10] Americans for Limited Government withholds donor names.[11]\n\nTerm limits[edit]\n\nIn 1992 Rich founded U.S. Term Limits which supports limits on the length of office of officials at the local, state, and federal levels.[12] He is chairman of U.S. Term Limits.[6] Rich financed many term limits movements in the 1990s.[4] In an editorial, Rich posed the question: \"Who's in charge \u2013 the people or politicians?\"[13] He criticized political connections between political contributors and government contractors and wrote: \"When government contracts are being handed out, all qualified companies should have a fair chance at getting public business, not just companies that donate to the re-election campaigns of entrenched politicians or hold cocktail parties at expensive restaurants in their honor.\"[13] He believes term limits are a way to restore popular control over government. He wrote: \"The longer politicians are in office, the more likely they are to rip us off for their own benefit \u2013 rewarding the donors who funded their campaigns and the special interests who keep them in power rather than the people they should be serving.\" He wrote that term limits force politicians \"to represent the people instead of advancing their own careers.\"[13] According to Rich, he and his groups have been successful in creating term limits for 37 governors, 15 state legislatures, and in nine large cities.[5] He is agitated by plans of the New York City Council to undo term-limit laws passed by a referendum, and compared a possible repeal to undoing the smoking ban.[5] In USA Today, he wrote in an editorial that American voters \"overwhelmingly support term limits\" and that \"citizens value fresh ideas, new perspectives and more competitive elections more than the so-called institutional knowledge of the political ruling class.\"[14] Rich has opposed New York City mayor Bloomberg's quest for a third mayoral term.[15] He opposes career politicians generally.[15] In 2008, a senior senator of the legislature of Nebraska blamed Rich and term limits for his \"forced retirement,\" but Rich responded in a letter to the editor of The New York Times that \"term limits have never been aimed at any one individual, but rather at an underlying culture of abuse that invariably tends to place the voracious appetites of government institutions over the best interests of the people they are there to serve.\"[16]\n\nProperty rights[edit]\n\nThe Kelo v. New London Supreme Court decision ruled that states could, at their discretion, decide whether it was permissible to permit property to be taken from some owners under the doctrine of eminent domain and given to other owners. There was a public backlash.[17] Rich helped engineer and encourage a number of ballot initiatives in state elections in 2006 to rein in such takings. Rich said \"I believe that property rights in many respects have been taken away from many property owners.\"[18] Property rights referendums on 12 state ballots became the \"biggest ballot issue\" in 2006.[19] As a result, in 2006 many states particularly in the west put initiatives on the ballot restricting eminent domain. Rich helped fund activities in favor of these initiatives.[17]\n\nRich supported a ballot initiative in California called Proposition 90 which prohibited cities from \"using their condemnation powers to transfer property from one owner to the other.\"[4][17] It generated significant controversy.[18] By September 2006, Rich gave $1.77 million to advocate \"yes\" on Proposition 90, dubbed by proponents as the Protect Our Homes Act, while various opponents gave $1.5 million to advocate against it.[18] A second estimate was that Rich gave $2.75 million via the Fund for Democracy and Americans for Limited Government to foster advocacy of eminent domain initiatives in California, Nevada, Arizona, Washington, Idaho and Montana. Another estimate was that by November 2006, Rich spent $15 million promoting state initiatives.[7]\n\nSometimes the group paid people as much as $4 to sign a petition to put the initiatives on the ballot, according to one report from the San Francisco Chronicle which ran editorials opposing the referendum.[20] According to a second source, prices paid for signatures to petition the ballot initiatives ranged from $1 in California to $3 in Arizona.[21] The San Francisco Chronicle, however, felt California's Proposition 90 initiative went too far and would restrict the power of the state government to create \"rights-of-way for utilities\" and it worried that states would be unable to enforce environmental laws since it would be required to compensate property owners for \"any substantial economic loss.\"[17] A reporter for USA Today suggested the referendums might \"gut local and state abilities to enact or enforce virtually any regulations affecting private land use and development.\"[21] Critics of the property rights proposals suggest the downside is \"voting to destroy all land-use regulation.\"[11]\n\nIn 2006, Americans for Limited Government and other groups spent millions trying to get property rights ballot initiatives in western states such as California, Washington, Idaho, and Arizona.[11] One estimate is that Rich contributed as much as $11 million to support property rights initiatives on ballots throughout much of the West.[11] The ballot initiatives succeeded in nine of eleven states but failed in California and Idaho.[22] In 2006, three of Rich's budget-trimming \"Taxpayer Bill of Rights\" proposals failed, but nine of his twelve eminent domain relief referenda passed overwhelmingly including states such as Louisiana, Florida, and South Carolina.[7] In total, 26 states passed laws that ban the use of eminent domain for economic development purposes.[11]\n\nEducational reform[edit]\n\nIn 2000 Rich founded the Legislative Education Action Drive, or LEAD, which focused on enacting school choice legislation across the country.[1] Rich is also chairman of the Parents in Charge Foundation.[1] Rich criticized American schools for being \"monopolistic\" and a \"millstone around our children's necks\" and wrote that \"America consistently (was) lagging behind its industrialized peers in academic achievement.\"[23] He felt a \"competitive education market\" would lead to \"innovation and improvement\" yet he believed the \"educational establishment\" is opposed to change.[23]\n\nBoard memberships[edit]\n\nRich is on the board of the Club for Growth.[4][6] It supports state affiliates across the nation.[1] He is also a director of the Cato Institute.[6][24] He also sits on the Board of Directors of the Friedman Foundation for Educational Choice.[25] Rich is president of U.S. Term Limits which is headquartered in Fairfax, VA.[24] He is a director of the Fund for Democracy which provides seed money to state initiative campaigns.[1] Rich also financially supported the libertarian magazine Reason.[2]\n\n\nRich also champions the position of holding \"judges accountable to the rule of law.\"[2] Rich criticized two 5-4 decisions by the Supreme CourtU.S. Term Limits v. Thornton and Kelo v. New London.[7] Rich said: \"The same Gang of Five who overrode millions of votes in favor of term limits in 23 states \u2013 ten years later sanctioned handing over private property to private developers to build condos.\"[7] Rich's group has done last-minute ad blitzes in judicial elections.[5]\n\nVotenet Solutions Ownership[edit]\n\nIn 2001 Rich acquired the web-based voting software and systems firm, Votenet Solutions[26] during the Dot-com bubble. Following the acquisition, federal investigators charged the company's CEO and CFO with embezzlement of hundreds of thousands of dollars from nonprofit clients and employee\u2019s 401(k).[27] Rich later referred to the ordeal as \"the most painful period of my business life.\" [26]\n\nCriticism and controversy[edit]\n\nCriticism from the Left[edit]\n\nRich has been described as being attacked by left-leaning activists; one reporter wrote \"'Howie Rich from New York City' has become the Left\u2019s latest whipping boy.\"[7] One pamphlet accused Rich of \"dirty tactics, hidden money streams, and shadowy operatives.\"[7] He's been accused of being a \"special interest group\" and of operating a \"tangled extremist web.\"[7] Rich responded: \"I have been fortunate enough to have been successful in business, and I want to do something in this life to advance liberty.\"[7] Rich said: \"It\u2019s very difficult in many of these states, and very expensive, to get these measures on the ballot ... All I have done here, for the most part, is provide seed money. All of these initiatives are left up to the voters. That\u2019s what these people, who consider money evil, are not willing to address. It\u2019s the voters in these states who ultimately make the decisions.\"[7]\n\nSecrecy or openness?[edit]\n\nA news report from National Public Radio on the show NOW on PBS accused Rich and his organizations of \"secretly providing major funding for ballot measures.\"[2] Rich was accused of using his political advocacy as a means to \"shield his portfolio from sticky-fingered bureaucrats\" but he countered \"It\u2019s a crock\" and said \"I own no real estate in any of the 12 states where we had property-rights initiatives on the ballot.\"[7] Rich has been vocal about his financial support of libertarian-related causes.[17] The San Francisco Chronicle wrote \"real estate mogul Howie Rich ... makes no secret of his desire to rein in the power of government.\"[17]\n\nLetters to donors controversy[edit]\n\nIn 2004, advocacy groups such as right-wing Swift Boat Veterans For Truth[28] and left-wing played a role in the presidential election contest of 2004. 527 money kept John Kerry going after cash dried up after the convention, and 527 money paid for the \"infamous Swift boat ads, which painted Mr. Kerry\u2019s military service in shameful hues, with little regard for documented history.\"[5] Questions about donations to these groups led to the Federal Election Commission sending subpoenas to donors requesting further information.[28] According to an account in NPR about these investigations of contributions, \"donors didn't like it.\"[4] Later, a letter campaign in August 2008 by the left-leaning organization Accountable America to donors of right-leaning organizations warned the donors about possible repercussions for contributing to right-wing organizations that might possibly be illegal; in another instance, a $100,000 reward was offered for information about \"unlawful conduct by business-oriented or conservative\" nonprofit groups and promised to publicize the \"'political and business relationships and corrupt activities' of donors to these causes.\"[5] Later, perhaps as a response to this activity by the left, Rich launched a donor-surveillance letter campaign aimed at liberal donors.[4] Rich's mailing was \"two months behind the Democrats\" letter campaign.[5] One estimate was that Rich sent 11,000 letters to left-leaning supporters of liberal causes.[5] According to an account in NPR, he was \"watchdogging all those limousine liberals with their checkbooks\".[4] Rich's letters to prominent liberal contributors of liberal causes told them that he's watching these donations; the letter read as follows: \"As a donor to one or more of these organizations and efforts, you have been able to engage in these activities without notice, operating in relative obscurity ... I am writing to inform you that this will no longer be the case.\"[4] There was a threat of exposing donations which violated laws or which were being funneled for illegal purposes.[4] According to a newspaper account afterwards, the letters from both sides tried to discourage donors to so-called 527 groups which is \"lightly regulated money\" that \"swamped the 2004 election.\"[5] Both liberals left-wing groups such as Accountable America and advocates such as Rich were criticized for \"trying to chill free speech\" with efforts to intimidate donors to political causes.[4]\n\n\nIn an interview in South Carolina, a reporter asked Rich: \"I don't know anyone who invests the kind of money without getting something in return?\" Rich replied:\n\nThere is great satisfaction. I went to public schools. My wife did. My two sons did. Here's an opportunity to give back something where kids will have an opportunity and parents will have an opportunity to go to a school of their choice not some school mandated by government. If every proposal that I have favored over the last 20 years got enacted, whether its term limits or school choice or property rights or any area \u2013 I get no personal benefit out of it. I don't make a nickel. Here in South Carolina I own no property. I have no businesses down here. So there's no real monetary benefit.[29]\n\n\nIn 2000, he received the Herman W. Lay Memorial Award for work in the educational arena.[1][30]\n\n\nRich has an office in the SoHo section of Manhattan.[5] He currently lives in Philadelphia with his wife Andrea, and is expanding his property portfolio to include foreign investments. He gives scholarships to talented kids to leave public schools and study at top private schools; it's called the Student Sponsor Partnership in New York.[citation needed]\n\n\n  1. ^ a b c d e f g h \"Howard S.

We thought he would outgrow it but he still does this. He doesn't spin things like he used to though. He hit all his milestones, except talking, on time.\n\nHe was a late talker, but is now is talking up a storm. He was evaluated autism when he had a speech evaluation, but passed. He has great eye contact, answers when called, very affectionate, and interacts with other children, though he is somewhat shy.\n\nHe is a pretty normal kid, just has those weird tics. DH and are are going to bring it up to our ped at his next appt, just to be sure.\n\nNow, instead of spinning things, he will watch his favorite TV show or something and stand up and start twiddling his fingers while rocking side to side on his feet. He is really excited when he does this. Part of me thinks he is just really excited and this is how he processes emotions etc, like I have read kids do when stimming, but I just want to know WHY. Will he outgrow it? I don't want him being ostracized at school... (right now he is home with me)\n\nHis appt is next month. I am just confused... is this kind of behavior normal?

Yet that insurance was not applicable until the injured player had missed 10 games for his NHL team.\n\nEvery NHL team pays insurance on each player contract, meaning if the player were to get hurt playing for that team, the insurance would pick up most of, if not all, of the salary. Yet, if a player were to get hurt participating for some other team \u2014 such as his country in the Olympics \u2014 then the insurance taken out by the team does not take effect.\n\nThat led many to believe that NHL teams were taking all of the risk sending their players to Sochi, Russia, with the IOC and IIHF reaping all the benefits. Yet NHL officials publicly had stated after the Games the IOC did have insurance, and by refusing to get into specifics, led many more people to believe NHL teams were covered entirely.\n\nWhat actually happened was a tense negotiation, with the NHL and NHLPA on one side and the IOC and IIHF on the other, concerning the league\u2019s participation in the 2014 Sochi Games. It was not resolved until July, well after the most recent collective bargaining agreement was reached in January 2013 between the NHL and its players. Part of that Olympic negotiation was to guard against NHL players suffering long-term injury while playing for their countries, and this 10-game provision was seemingly the solution.\n\nKnowing the players desperately wanted to participate in the Games, the NHL had very little leverage in trying to get the IOC to take out full insurance, and the compromise was this 10-game space during which the league\u2019s teams took on all of the risk.\n\nIt certainly irked many team executives, including Islanders general manager Garth Snow, when he publicly vented after his star player, John Tavares, suffered a season-ending knee injury while playing for Team Canada.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a joke,\u201d Snow told Newsday the day after Tavares tore the MCL and meniscus in his left knee in a group-stage game against Latvia. \u201cThey want all the benefits from NHL players in Olympics and don\u2019t want to pay when our best player gets hurt.\u201d\n\nThe result for Snow and his cash-strapped organization is they are left on the hook for approximately $609,756 of Tavares\u2019 remaining $1.341 million owed this season on his $5 million contract. (He carries an annual $5.5 million salary-cap hit, and is signed for the next four seasons after this.)\n\nWith 22 games remaining, starting with Thursday night\u2019s Coliseum match against the Maple Leafs, that means the IOC insurance will pick up the tab for the final 12 games, an approximate total of $731,707.\n\nBeyond Tavares, the Red Wings lost captain Henrik Zetterberg, who suffered a herniated disk while playing for Sweden and likely will miss eight weeks. The Panthers lost Tomas Kopecky indefinitely after he suffered a concussion while playing for Slovakia, as well as talented 18-year-old forward Aleksander Barkov, out four-to-six weeks with a knee injury suffered while playing for Russia.\n\nThen there are teams such as the Rangers, who lost forward Mats Zuccarello for just about two weeks to a broken hand, and will have to foot that bill out of pocket, and also the Blue Jackets, who lost defenseman Fedor Tyutin for two-to-three weeks with an ankle injury.\n\nIt leads to the question of the league\u2019s possible participation in the 2018 Olympics, set to take place in Pyeongchang, South Korea, a 14-hour time difference from the east coast of North America.\n\n\u201cTo stop the whole season for almost three weeks? I don\u2019t know,\u201d Rangers coach Alain Vigneault said Saturday about the future of NHL players in the Olympics. \u201cSome great races going on, now a couple teams have lost some key players. \u2026 We\u2019ll let the big boys decide that.\u201d\n\n\nMost Popular This Week\n\nShare Selection"}

Wanda looks to Carl for some help who in turn is looking for some help with Rodney. They soon see that Rodney's the only one that can make Zoe stop crying. When he gets home from work, Darryl is amazed that Rodney is Zoe's new babysitter. Melinda is amazed when she comes over late that night to claim Rodney, only to find him sleeping peacefully with Zoe. Wanting some time apart from her son as much as Darryl and Wanda want some time apart from Zoe's crying, Melinda leaves him there which is fine with the MacPhersons since it means they get to have sex that night. The next morning, Rodney doesn't want to leave and his parents don't want him to leave even though Megan wants him back. Darryl makes him leave, and Zoe goes right back to crying. He and Wanda have no choice but to take Rodney in as Zoe's full-time babysitter. But it doesn't take long before the little extortionist demands money out of the MacPhersons to continue keeping Zoe quiet. At one point, Megan gets so lonely that she and Shelby visit Rodney. Megan demands Rodney to come back, but Rodney says that he's now a full-time babysitter and that he can't leave. So she and Shelby (who was hitting his bat on the ground constantly when they were leaving) leave. Then Darryl and Wanda's parents come to visit to see their granddaughter, and are horrified that they're letting her sleep with an 8-year-old. After they paint a picture of Zoe growing up to be a hoodlum who says she wants to kill her parents on The Jerry Springer Show, Darryl and Wanda tell an unhappy Carl he has to take Rodney home. It's a rough night for both of them, but Wanda finally gets Zoe to sleep on her own. Plus, Carl, plus Melinda and Megan laugh when he tells a joke to them.\nNo results found.\nNo results found.\nNo results found."}

The question is how well would it scale? When I run the same program on a 4- or 8-core machine will it go proportionally faster?\n\nNot many of us have 8- or 16-core machine sitting under their desk, so testing programs for scalability sounds out of the reach of most of us. Intel has come to the rescue by making available for public use a multicore lab which is accessed through the Intel Parallel Universe Portal.\n\nIn a nutshell to test a programs scalability all that has to be done is login onto the portal, upload your executable as a zip file, fill in the command-line options and wait for the results to be available. The jobs you submit are queued, so time taken to get the results will depend on how busy the portal is when I did my tests I had to wait about 40 minutes for the results. There are more details in this FAQ\n\nBy using Intel Parallel Portal one can easily see how well a program scales.. In my case, after making some changes to the code - mainly to do with increasing the level of granularity of my threaded code then I reran the tests and did a comparison of the two runs, showing that my changes had a positive impact on the scalability..\u00a0 Submitting the applications were really easy, and I liked the way the results were presented.\n\n\n\nHere's a log \\screenshots of the steps I did to get the results.\n\n1. Registering for the first time\n\nFirst of all for go\u00a0 to the\u00a0 Intel Parallel Universe Portal \u00a0\n\nPress the start here button\n\nYou will then be asked to submit some contact details, type in a few letters and accept the terms of reference.\n\n2. Subscription request acceptance\n\nAfter a short pause, your subscription request will be confirmed and an email sent to you.\n\n3. The Subscription Confirmation email\n\nThe confirmation email has the link where you can submit your first application. You can then click on the link to start using the service.\n\n4. Submitting an application for Analysis\n\nSTEP1 - Preparing the application for upload\n\nTo test an application the portal requires a single zip file that contains the application exe and any supporting file.\n\n\nSTEP2 - Giving the command-line parameters\n\nIn the second step you supply the command-line parameters for the application. If\u00a0 you don't need any command line options just leave the Arguments box blank.\n\n\nSTEP3 - Uploading the application\n\nBy pressing the Submit button, the application zip file\u00a0 is uploaded.\n\n\n\nSTEP4 - Confirmation of when job will run\n\nThe portal will confirm that the job has been accepted and gives an estimate on when the job will be run. The application will be listed as IN PROGRESS. You can't submit a second application while you have one in progress.\n\n\n5. Viewing the Results\n\nWhen the application has been run, the web page will be updated so that the status says DONE. You will also be sent a confirmation email.\n\n\n\n\nThe Confirmation Email\n\n6. The Summary Report\n\nThe report appears on the screen giving a set of graphs showing elapsed time, average concurrency, performance improvement and throughput scalability.\n\n\nIn my case the test for core 1 did not run, I wasn't sure of the reason why.\n\n\n7. Downloading the results file\n\nYou can download the results by clicking on the \"Download Intel Parallel Amplifier report \" at the top of the report.\n\n\nThe reports are delivered in a zip file. When it is extracted there are separate folders for each run that was performed.\n\n\n\n8. Comparing results\n\nIf you upload and run\u00a0 more than one application you can ask the Parallel Universe portal to compare the results of them\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Reading\n\nMore Insights\n\nCurrently we allow the following HTML tags in comments:\n\nSingle tags\n\n\n<br> Defines a single line break\n\n<hr> Defines a horizontal line\n\nMatching tags\n\n\n<a> Defines an anchor\n\n<b> Defines bold text\n\n<big> Defines big text\n\n<blockquote> Defines a long quotation\n\n<caption> Defines a table caption\n\n<cite> Defines a citation\n\n<code> Defines computer code text\n\n<em> Defines emphasized text\n\n<fieldset> Defines a border around elements in a form\n\n<h1> This is heading 1\n\n<h2> This is heading 2\n\n<h3> This is heading 3\n\n<h4> This is heading 4\n\n<h5> This is heading 5\n\n<h6> This is heading 6\n\n<i> Defines italic text\n\n<p> Defines a paragraph\n\n<pre> Defines preformatted text\n\n<q> Defines a short quotation\n\n<samp> Defines sample computer code text\n\n<small> Defines small text\n\n<span> Defines a section in a document\n\n<s> Defines strikethrough text\n\n<strike> Defines strikethrough text\n\n<strong> Defines strong text\n\n<sub> Defines subscripted text\n\n<sup> Defines superscripted text\n\n<u> Defines underlined text\n\n"}

The IMB Piracy Reporting Centre [official website] (PRC) received reports [materials] of 177 incidents in the first six months of this year, compared to 266 incidents for the same period in 2011. So far in 2012, 20 vessels were actually hijacked with 334 crew members taken hostage, and 80 vessels were boarded, 25 vessels were fired upon and 52 vessels reported attempted pirate attacks. Contributing to the piracy decrease [The Maritime Executive report] is the effective deployment of Best Management Practices, ship hardening and, in particular, the increased use of Privately Contracted Armed Security Personnel (PCASP). The IMB PRC operates 24 hours a day to disseminate reports of piracy attacks across the globe:\nThe IMB attributes the drop in overall piracy primarily to a decline in incidents of Somali pirate activity, down from 163 last year to 69 in 2012. The IMB credits the pre-emptive and disruptive counter piracy tactics employed by the international navies in stifling the Somali pirate activity.\n\n\n\nFor more legal news check the Paper Chase Archive...\n\n\n\u00a0Oman court sentences former executive to 15 years for bribery\n3:25 PM ET, March 9\n\n\u00a0North Korea holds first parliamentary elections under Kim Jong-un\n2:50 PM ET, March 9\n\n\u00a0Administrative judge strikes down FAA ban on commercial drones\n12:57 PM ET, March 9\n\n\u00a0click for more...\n\nGet JURIST legal news delivered daily to your e-mail!\n\n\nHeckler's Vetoes in High School\nAshutosh Bhagwat\nUniversity of California, Davis School of Law\n\n\n\n"}

I think it took 5.5 hanks? Maybe 6. I can\u2019t find the original receipt, so I\u2019m not sure how many I started with.\n\nSize 8 bamboo\n\nOctober 28, 2006\nCompleted: December 28, 2006\n\nAccording to EZ\u2019s directions, I knit the t-shirt yoke. You knit one saddle, bind off half the stitches and continue knitting the half saddle across the back and graft it to the second saddle. It makes the back of the sweater a little higher than the front. You may remember that there was going to be a gray cross on the front as well, but I\u2019ve scrapped it for now. I may duplicate stitch it in later on, we\u2019ll see.\n\nFinal Verdict:\nI love it! The Husband has been wearing it since the photoshoot, so I\u2019d say it was worth waiting for.\n\n\n  \u2022 Amy Mac said:\n\n    Congratulations! It looks fantastic!\n\n  \u2022 Kim said:\n\n    It\u2019s so gorgeous. The perfect sweater!\n\n  \u2022 Areli said:\n\n    Wow! That\u2019s really amazing.

Your details, including the contrasting color inside hems and collar, are perfection. You deserve to be proud!\n\n  \u2022 Debbie said:\n\n    OOOOooooOOOOoooohhh, what a handsome sweater.

I can\u2019t wait for the new episodes of Uncommon Threads either \u2013 it\u2019s so very cool!

The color, the fit, etc., are fabulous and\u2026 he\u2019s wearing it?!?!? WOW! haha That\u2019s what\u2019s always held me back from knitting anything for my husband. He\u2019s so picky. But I really do think he would like an EZ Hybrid. And if he didn\u2019t, I would definitely wear it for him. :)\n\n  \u2022 Susan said:\n\n    That looks so great! Especially the hem- turn down in the accent color! Wow. Very professional. You should be proud!\n\n  \u2022 s t a c i said:\n\n    I\u2019m about 3/4 of the way through this sweater now, and I love the recipe. (I bought the book after seeing how nicely yours was coming out.) I am, however, having difficulty fitting the saddle shoulders to Chris. I\u2019ve ripped it back once, and now I\u2019ve downgraded to raglan. :( I think top-down might be the answer for his future sweaters.\n    But your\u2019s is a perfect fit!

When I first saw that pattern knitted up (I think it was in burgundy and on another blog a while back) I knew it would be perfect for my husband, who is near impossible to fit (a raglan would work, but I like the look of this one much better than a basic raglan). I will have to add it to my list to knit in 2007, especially since I just showed these photos to him and he likes it a lot.\n\n  \u2022 Abbe said:\n\n    Wow Caro! That is true classic.\n\n  \u2022 Kelli said:\n\n    Good for you! That sweater looks fantastic. And I am so, so sorry we didn\u2019t get to meet up.

I can\u2019t wait to read more of it.\n    Can you e-mail me when you get a moment? Which TV show are you going to be on? Any word on air date yet?

For years, it has been heard through the news that women can have multiple orgasms, a term that refers to the ability to have a very intense orgasm with mini orgasms within the same orgasm or afterwards. In a word, something super intense that lasts more than the usual regular orgasm.\nWomen's reproductive organs are very different from the male's one, especially when it comes to the physiology of an orgasm. Females have the clitoris, which is probably the part of their body with more sensation and more nerve endings, males have their \"clitoris\", which is located just under the shaft of the penis tip, very sensibly area.\nWhat about the G-Spot? The G-spot has gained major attention in the last years and males go crazy trying to find out where this spot is to pleasure their partner, but what about a male's G-Spot? Do we have one? If we do, is there a way to stimulate it to have the same effect that women do? Have a multi-orgasm? Actually we do, its not as perfect as it is in females, but our prostate gland serves as the male's g-spot area.\n\nSo how can males have a multi-orgasm? There are several ways, but I will concentrate on the main two. This method helps to increase sensitivity, helps to fight premature ejaculation problems and it intensifies the orgasmic sensation, making it last longer or have multiple.\nA good way to master this technique is through masturbation and for those who think is bad for you, no its not, its healthy and super natural. Through Masturbation you can know what you like, dislike and your limits.\n\nLets pay attention now and get to this, females this is good stuff for you as well, you got to pleasure your partner, too.\nIf you are doing this manually, during intercourse or an oral session do the following:\nWhile in the act, if you feel that an orgasm is approaching try to stop and add some pressure with your finger to the tip of the penis and wait for 20-30 seconds before continuing the act. You can also pull gently down on your testicles when you feel its coming, this will prevent you from having an orgasm, for now.\nThis will be hard, especially for those who have premature ejaculation, but believe me, by doing this you are re-training your nerve endings. Try doing this for a few minutes and this will give you a more powerful orgasm, if you are lucky, multiple of them. Also, this is a great exercise to get rid of premature ejaculation.\n\nAnother great exercise you can do to be multi-orgasmic is to stimulate your prostate gland. You can massage the area between your anus and testicles, adding pressure and massaging it while in the act will increase sensitivity and intensify your orgasm.\nIf you are more brave then you can insert your finger slowly where the sun doesn't shine until you feel a walnut size object, your prostate. Once you feel it, massage it slowly and increase pressure as you go, this is your g-spot, if you are in there already, take advantage of it!\nAhhh, one thing, you can ask your partner to do this while you concentrate on doing other things, so now go give it a try to one of the two and tell me what you think. Good Luck!\n\n\nPenis Surgery Patient Sends Bomb To Doctor\n\nTuesday, December 05, 2006\nWant to hear something really crazy? Black Steidler, a 25 year old from Philadelphia apparently was very unsatisfied with the results of his penis enlargement surgery that he opted to send a little gift to his surgeon. A bomb was the gift this genius patient decided to take to his surgeon via snail-mail.\n\nA man who mailed a bomb to a doctor because he was angry about how his penis enlargement surgery turned out was sentenced to four years and 10 months in prison.\n\nUnbelievable or not, mr. Steidler returned home and immediately called 911 telling them what exactly he had done; the bomb was safely removed and no one was injured.\nSo what did Mr. Steidler gain from this experience? A very unsatisfied result, some prison time and a 3-5 years supervisory released plus a $2,000 fine. If you ask me, that is a very arduous process to go through after penis enlargement surgery.\n\n\nThe Best 10 Condoms To Use\n\nSaturday, December 02, 2006\nWhen it comes to sex and being safe there is nothing as protective as abstinence, but who wants to abstinent from sex nowadays?\nTo have a healthy sexual relationship is to be careful of all of the Sexually Transmitted Diseases out there, which are many and day by day they are becoming more aggresive.\n\nCondoms are one of the most used sources of STDs prevention and unwanted pregnancies.

As a VGA camera phone with a standard flip design, it offers basic features and little style. Yet, since that's really the whole point, we're not going to complain. Comfortable controls and decent call quality give the SGH-T139 a minimalist appeal, and you can't beat the price. Also called the Mayon, the handset is free with an Even More plan (that's with a contract) and $59.99 with an Even More Plus plan (without a contract).\n\nThe T139 is the very definition of a flip phone. The blue-gray handset has smooth lines and a compact shape (3.7 inches tall by 1.9 inches wide by 0.7 inch thick; 2.98 ounces) than lends itself to easy travel. Besides a diamond pattern on the rear cover there are no design elements to distract from the phone's obvious purpose of making calls. The handset's plastic skin doesn't give it a durable feel, so we suggest carrying the phone in a pocket or bag.\n\nThe external display is just 1 inch diagonal, and the resolution is low (96x96 pixels). It shows the date, time, battery life, signal strength and numeric caller ID, but it won't work as a self-portrait viewfinder for the camera, which sits just above. On the left spine you'll find the volume rocker and the right spine has a camera shutter/lock control and a combined headset jack/charger port. Unfortunately, the latter uses a proprietary Samsung connection.\n\nThe internal display is also a bit small for the phone's size (1.75 inches). It supports 65,000 colors, so it's not the most vibrant display either, but it's suitable on a basic phone like the T139. The menus are easy to use, and you can change display options like standby text style and color, the dialing font size and the backlight time.\n\nThe SGH-T139's keypad and controls are its best design features. Both have spacious layouts with raised button that have a comfortable, rubbery feel. The diamond-shaped four-way toggle is clad in silver, which sets it apart from the black controls. You'll also find a central OK button, two soft keys, the Talk and End/power button, and a Clear control. The backlit keypad buttons feature large numbers and letters. We could text and dial quickly without any problems.\n\nThe SGH-T139's phone book holds 300 contacts with room in each entry for five phone numbers, an e-mail address, and notes. You can add callers to groups and pair them with a photo and one of 10 40-chord polyphonic ringtones. Other essentials include text and multimedia messaging, an alarm clock, a calendar, a task list, a calculator, a tip calculator, a world clock, a timer, a stopwatch, and a unit and currency converter.\n\nYou don't get much else beyond the basics, but Samsung included the most useful options. There's a voice recorder, instant messaging, Bluetooth, and the capability to send audio postcards with photos and a voice recording. There's no integrated e-mail app, but you can always get online through the WAP 2.0 browser.\n\nEditors' Top PicksSee All\n\n\nJoin the discussion\n\nConversation powered by Livefyre\n\nWhere to Buy See all prices\n\nSamsung SGH-T139 - gray (T-Mobile)\n\nPart Number: T139MAYONGRYTMB Released: Feb 3, 2010\nMSRP: $59.99 Low Price: $39.99 See all prices\n\nQuick Specifications See All\n\n  \u2022 Release date Feb 3, 2010\n  \u2022 Service Provider T-Mobile"}

I like the use of the two-seamer to maybe generate some extra groundballs, but he still gave up his fair share of flyballs last year. His curve and slider both have some break to them, but that didn\u2019t seem to make them all that hard to hit. Though, of course, that might have had something to do with batters being willing to let them go by (given Arrieta\u2019s control issues often put him in unfavorable counts) unless they\u2019re meat-balls.\n"}

In a large tent pavilion, other ladies hired as exotic dancers swung around poles (brass) on elevated platforms as tourist awkwardly took cell phone video.\n\nAs 9:30 p.m. passed, a forgettable opening act came and went.\n\nThen a \"video DJ\" from Las Vegas, \"Ronnie G,\" took the stage and absolutely whipped the crowd into a frenzy with wildly eclectic music and video clips projected on a gigantic Jumbotron.\n\nPicture him mixing video and audio tracks from:\n\n* Ozzy Osbourne \"Crazy Train\" with the composer John Williams' theme from \"Raiders of the Lost Ark.\"\n\n* Fergie's \"My Humps\" with AC/DC's \"She Shook Me All Night Long.\"\n\n* \"The Jeffersons\" theme of \"Movin' On Up,\" with Gun's & Roses \"Sweet Child O' Mine\" with video from Saturday Night Fever, Napoleon Dynamite, 300 (\"This is Sparta!!\"), Batman and 100 other clips and tracks in dynamic sequence.\n\nWhen Ronnie G started throwing DVDs to the crowd, the masses pretty thoroughly climaxed. He gave the crowd his all, and badly blew out his knee jumping from the stage after the show. Later, he sat in his trailer backstage, rubbing his twisted leg and taking congratulations from a line of new admirers.\nStill, everyone wanted Snoop. Word was, one of rap music's greatest legends sat relaxing his trailer, immune to concert staff trying to start his show. Meanwhile in the crowd, guys took endless cell phone photos and ambitious women pleaded with security staff for access backstage (successfully, I might add).\n\nWithout Snoop, Sarah Morrow from Sioux City, Iowa, ached with shivering anticipation, leaning on the aluminum rail that separated crowd from stage. \"I want to hear his old school stuff,\" she pleaded.\n\nCrystal Carlisle from Florida did pushups on the rail to keep warm - wildly entertaining guys nearby.\n\nSecurity guards at the stage edge tried telling the front-row crowd \"No Cameras. No Photos.\" This worked as well as telling the ocean to quit making the beach so wet.\n\nThen from what sounded like 1,001 speakers, blared the classic symphonic anthem \"O Fortuna,\" known as a near-universal theme for Big, Nasty, Glorious, Battles.\n\n\n\"Bow, wow, wow. Yippie yo. Yippie yeah,\" Snoop almost cooed to an ecstatic, bouncing crowd.\n\nNow, remember this. Don't go to a Snoop Dogg concert if you have delicate ears or delicate sensibilities. He curses with frequency and poise.\n\nI won't quote.\n\nBut Snoop gave up tracks from his most modern CDs, plus the old-school rhymes that first made him famous and broke the door of MTV down for the dawning of modern rap: \"1, 2, 3, and to the 4. Snoop Dog and Dr. Dre are at the door.\"\n\nOther rappers may scream, or mumble.\n\nNot Snoop. He calmly rolls out casually rhymes like he's lounging on a couch, talking into a phone, or soothing a youngster that everything's going to be OK.\n\nThe crowd went nuts. Even the exotic dancers 100 yards away switched their routines to match Snoop's rhymes and beats. Snoop took the crowd through is 15+ years of music.\n\n\"Can I get a bounce, bounce?\" Snoop asked.\n\nYes, yes, he could. That's what people come to hear Snoop say.\n\nAs an epilogue: Just an hour later, it was over. And 10,000 people flooded into one of two places:\n\n1) The Channelside parking garage and its new, jabberwocky payment system that requires a complex combination of yellow \"payment chips,\" maddening credit card kiosks and paper receipts. It didn't go well.\n\n2) Any of a dozen private and semi-private parties in the district. The new AJA ultralounge, the \"Girls Gone Wild\" party in the renovated movie theater complex and one event plainly named \"The Party\" in the upper floors of the Towers at Channelside. Each had its own set of velvet ropes, gigantic security guards and model hosts checking their clipboards for names of VIPs.\n\nNever, I think, has Channnelside seen so many people.\n\nTribune reporter Richard Mullins can be reached at (813) 259-7919.\n\nView allPage 1 of 2 | Next page\n\nPage 2 of 2 | View all Previous page\n\nSubscribe to The Tampa Tribune"}

Congo, Verizon's director of information technology and executive sponsor of the community outreach program. \u00a0\"The program was designed to emphasize the real-life, everyday use of robots in our society and generate interest in careers in science, technology, engineering and mathematics [STEM].\u00a0\n\n\"Our goal was to demystify the knowledge and skills needed to pursue technical careers by offering students hands-on experience through our robotics program,\" Congo added.\u00a0 \"We are so pleased at the excitement this program has generated and, more importantly, at what the students have learned and were able to accomplish.\"\n\nDuring the closing ceremony, students displayed the robots they created and shared their experiences in the robotics program.\u00a0 Verizon awarded each student an iPod Shuffle and a variety of other prizes.\n\nPandit F. Wright, president and CEO of the Boys & Girls Clubs of Greater Washington, said: \"During after-school hours in America, approximately 15 million children are at home with no adult care or supervision.\u00a0 Support from partners like Verizon is critical to ensuring that every child we serve has a safe and positive place to go after school. \u00a0We are grateful for the work Verizon and its employees have done with creating impactful character-building programs for our young people.\"\n\nAt the program's kickoff session last September, students saw different examples of robots performing many critical, automated tasks ranging from basic mathematic functions to brain surgery.\u00a0\n\nThe students learned that robots take many forms, such as humanoid, submersible and industrial.\u00a0 And the students were exposed to famous robots, such as the Mars Rover; the British Petroleum remotely operated vehicle that was essential to cleaning up the Gulf oil spill; and Asimov, a humanoid robot that walks, climbs stairs and supports the disabled.\n\nCongo said: \"The Verizon volunteer team, with support from the Boys & Girls Clubs staff, set out to ensure that our budding technologists had a challenging, informative and fun experience while applying STEM concepts to build, program and operate their robots.\u00a0 Each week promised new learning opportunities.\"\n\nStudents successfully completed the program and built fully functional robots capable of navigating with programmed commands; reporting sensor status with light and sound; and escaping contact by touch using whisker sensors.\n\nVerizon's information technology team, which has members around the world, has partnered with organizations that help at-risk, disadvantaged and underprivileged youth by mentoring and training them in technology, leadership and literacy.\u00a0 These organizations include local Boys & Girls Clubs, YMCAs, schools and other community-based groups.\n\nAbout Boys & Girls Clubs of Greater Washington\nCelebrating 126 years of continuous service to children, teens and families, Boys & Girls Clubs of Greater Washington (BGCGW) is one of the largest affiliates of Boys & Girls Clubs of America (BGCA).\u00a0 BGCGW serves over 16,500 youth annually at 18 sites throughout Washington, D.C., Maryland and Virginia, including Camp Brown, a 168-acre residential summer camp. \u00a0Through a variety of educational, sports and recreation, health, arts, and character development programs, BGCGW creates a positive environment where children are encouraged to develop their ambitions and turn them into GREAT FUTURES. \u00a0BGCGW helps boys and girls of all backgrounds, especially those who need us most, build confidence, develop character, and acquire skills that prepare them for school and for life as productive, civic-minded and responsible adults. \u00a0For more information, please call 202-540-2300 or visit our website at\n\nAbout Verizon\n\nSOURCE Verizon\n\n\nFeatured Video\n\nJournalists and Bloggers\n\n\n\nShare with Twitter Share with LinkedIn\n\nCustom Packages\n\n\nStart today.\n\n\n\nPR Newswire Membership\n\n\n\nLearn about PR Newswire services\n\n\n\nOnline Member Center\n\nNot a Member?\nClick Here to Join\nSearch News Releases\nAdvanced Search\n  1.

Well, it doesn't look like you have much longer to wait before the dual device hits online stores.\u00a0\n\nDell is expected to officially release the 10-inch Inspiron Duo next week, possibly on 23 November, according to our sister site It will be available for order on Dell's website.\n\nWe've seen hybrid laptop-tablets before, but nothing quite like the Duo. As well as taking advantage of a new market created by the iPad and followed by devices such as the Samsung Galaxy Tab, its unique design has actually drawn gasps from people who've seen it. Here's a video showing just how the two-in-one gadget works.\n\nAs you can see, the tablet splits open to reveal a keyboard underneath. The screen swivels within the frame and -- abracadabra -- you have yourself a flipped-out new netbook. The design is brilliant, though we're not sure how robust it is, but obviously Dell has been able to manufacture it in large quantities.\n\nAnother question hangs over that tablet touchscreen. Usability is one area in which new tablet devices have succeeded where older tablets failed. Touching and moving things with your fingertips is now an enjoyable experience, rather than a frustrating chore.\n\nThe Dell Inspiron Duo is set to run on Windows 7, which wasn't designed for tablets. The operating system will work fine for the netbook side of things, but if the tablet is difficult to use, it could kill the Duo stone dead.\n\nThis is why we have nagging doubts. We love the look of the Inspiron Duo, but we need to see that tablet side of it responsive and working well before we commend Dell's efforts. Otherwise, it's just another netbook, with a tablet gimmick attached. We'll know more with a full review.\n\nComments 2\n\nAdd your comment\n\nAnonymous's avatar\n\nAnonymous 2 April, 2011 15:12\n\nhow can i buy this netbook?\nplease give me more inforamtion or direct link\n\nthank you\n\nAnonymous's avatar\n\nAnonymous 5 April, 2011 16:14\n\nWhere ca I buy this netbook in New York city.\nThe Dell computers there a \u00c2\u00b4fisic store...\n\n\n\nPost your comment\n\n\nYour email will not be displayed with your comment\n\n\nYour comment must comply with the Terms of Use\n\nAbout CBS Interactive\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2014 CBS Interactive Limited.

Why is Petrojam considering importing ultra-low sulphur diesel, until their refinery is upgraded? Isn't this an admission that the present diesel oil on the market is not 'up to par'?\n\nCountries and companies do not unilaterally set standards and have a minister with oversight for energy sign off on same and then say you have adhered to prescribed standards, nor does the 'Government of Jamaica Petroleum Quality Control Act' mean anything if they are not in keeping with international standards.\n\nTo take it to the ridiculous, Jamaica might just as well start researching the setting of Jamaica Standards for Nuclear Fusion as this may be the answer to mankind's future energy solution.\n\nFor Petrojam to say that they have adhered to these standards and are in compliance with them is hogwash, when owners of diesel motor vehicles are suffering physical, emotional and financial stress because of this 'up to par' diesel oil.\n\nuneconomical product\n\nI am sure that, except for the bauxite companies, Petrojam has one of the largest contingents of chemical engineers on staff. These engineers should advise themselves that were the manufacturers of diesel engines to develop an engine to genuinely manage this high sulphur content, then the metal or alloy used would render the cost of that engine uneconomical, and what, then, of the emissions?\n\nThere are protocols and standards which are recognised internationally by conventions and otherwise, that countries, even Third World ones like Jamaica, should adhere to.\n\nJamaica does not manufacture diesel engines, so they cannot set standards for engines outside of the specifications of manufacturers who are adhering to international standards.\n\nIn the article, Petrojam mentioned being environmental stewards and refer to the blending of ethanol, thereby reducing emission of lead. While this is commendable, it was not their environmental consciousness that achieved this but, rather, it was as a consequence of the main aim of reducing the cost of input into petrol to ensure greater profitability.\n\n\n\nShare |\n\nblog comments powered by Disqus\n\nTop Jobs\n\nView all Jobs"}

The church hid these pedophiles and lied on their behalf for decades. I say crush them. Bring them to their knees. Pound a stake thru their hearts like the priest did to little Johnny. I\u2019m only disappointed they can\u2019t sue Rome and gets their hands on those assets!!!\n\n\nIn my work with abused children, I found that some victims react to abuse by becoming perpetrators themselves. Others go the opposite direction and become firmly resolved to never harm other people and to never make someone feel the way they felt.\nThese groups that sue the churches are only creating new victims. The people who send their children to the parish school or attend the church are the ones who suffer from these bankruptcies.\nThese lawsuits are not about justice. They are about greed and anger. That is why they go after the church community as a whole. If they just want justice they should sue the individual people responsible, not the entire institution. Like most civil suits, this is more about money than justice. What justice is there in creating new victims?\n\n\nWell at last, some comments about the abuses of the catholic church, its not much but surelly better than wat we see every day, as in nothing. I believe its a shame that it is the archdiocese that must pay for all the well deserve and invisible \"gentle punishments\" of the catholic church, it should be the hole vatican!!. I really would like to know the total amount of assests of the whole catholic church, well my friend this is a data that any of us will ever know!!!!! because it is simply too much, bilinons of dollars at the least.\n\n\nWhy a lot of people dont want to see this????.......well first we have ignorance, if your not educated you cant think in a critique kind of way. Second, like the origins of the creation of the church (creating a power,and still is) church alows the ones who suport it, even if they know all the rape, crimes and thievery going on, to share a certain amount of power with them if they close their eyes on what they see, at the end the church is not about GOD but about MANAGING IGNORANCE AND CREATING POWER from it.\n\n\nThe books: CRIMINAL HISTORY OF CHRISTIANITY (catholic church)\n\nthere is so much things to say about it that there are at least over 7 tomes of them... Good reading and education!!\n\nTell me something before I go, did Jesus had a church, well he was jewish, but did he told his preayer and preached in a millions worth of assets church?? what did he thaught about these kind of establishment??\nGOD is about doing what is the best for our brothers and sisters, not to try to appear doing so and behind raping one of your daugthers of sons.\n\nCurate's Egg\n\n\nAs a Catholic, I disagree with you. Catholic priests take a vow of poverty and are indeed poor. Since the American legal system prevents defendants from claims driving any individual into economic destitution, suing individual priests will not get victims a dime.\n\n\nErr, no. The story the Church systematically hiding and lying for pedophile priests is a popular myth, greatly exaggerated beyond its isolated extent. But people do love a story involving sex, religion and criminality...\n\nperrissimo abbas\n\nPolish.pincone apparently stood on a pine needle and lost his concentration.\n\nThe headline was \"Chapter 11 Verse 8\". That was informative.\n\nVerse 8. Lots of lawsuits. The number of lawsuits is climbing.\n\nGet it?\n\n\nI think that these Catholic Church bashers would have a lot more credibility, if we could believe that all of this was ONLY about abusive priests.\nUnfortunately, underneath it all, I get a sense that what they are really saying to the Catholic Church is -\n\"1. I do not agree with your teachings.\n2. I resent that you have so much influence in the world.\n3. I want to find a way to hurt you. \"\n\n\nthe economist, and every media outlet for that matter, has covered the story of bishops moving around pedophiles and now that its exposed people should be held accountable and billions of dollars in lawsuits should come, they say.\n\nwhat people don't get is that none of this was illegal. employers (a diocese in this case) were not required to notify the authority's if they suspected (or knew) that an employee committed a crime.\n\ni live in Ohio and it is actually illegal under the law to fire a public school teacher who has been alleged of child molestation. the school is only aloud to legally fire him if convicted in criminal court . this almost never happens .\n\n\nCurate's Egg and little_adolph further illustrate my point that these lawsuits are all about the money.\nlittle_adolph wrote \"I\u2019m only disappointed they can\u2019t sue Rome and gets their hands on those assets!!!\"\nCurate's Egg wrote \"suing individual priests will not get victims a dime.\"\n\nWhat is the going fair market price for abuse? How much money will make the abuse acceptable? How much money will restore innocence to the victims and erase their pain? Not everything in life can be reduced to money. When people do make it about money, greed and anger (not justice) become the driving motives. And again, where does the money end up coming from? From the pockets of lots of common everyday people who had nothing to do with the abuse and may even have family members that were abused. It's madness.\n\nEven more maddenning is the fact that in these type of suits the victims often end up with small amounts of money compared to the attorneys who end up with millions.\n\n\nStop calling it by the establishment's euphemism \"abuse\" and say what it really is: \"Child Rape\".\n\n\nDear Ned26,\n\nWell I'm afraid you have to take the word of \"Saint\" Paul and his ilk about the virginity bit. The fact that Paul never even met his saviour and clearly had a large number of big axes to grind does somewhat cast his and his followers' testimony into doubt. Why not try scientific analysis for a change instead of pure faith.\n\nthe sovereign\n\nThe hand wringing over pedophile scandals in The Catholic Church is missing the point. The Church, as the preponderate religious leader,\nought to have a perfect grasp of human needs. The Creator, through Its agency of Nature, blessed Humanity with the absolutely powerful instinct in sex, which is the most thoroughly efficient dynamic to safeguard our survival. To insist on the spiritual preeminence of sexual abstinence as the most divinely bequeathed privilege of all spiritual-loving persons is fatuous and destructive. No one truly comes to understand the designs of The Father, by setting oneself against the very dynamics that The Divinity conferred on Humanity.\n\nCurate's Egg\n\n\nAh s**t, my comment got cut off...\n\nAnyways, it's important to remember that these priest sex abuse cases happened across decades and the society's perception of adolescent sexual abuse and its responses to it were vastly lenient once compared to our standards today. Secrecy and a slap on the wrist was the order of the day for such sordid affairs in the olden days of the 20th century, and this applied to not just the Church but the wider society as a whole, unfortunately...\n\n\nThis institution is evil.\nInstitutions are NOT needed in order for one to lead a religious life, if one so chooses.\nThe Vatican is all about political power over people's minds, as it has been since its foundation as a Papacy.\nIt tries to hide this power as 'goodness'.\nOnce again it has been seriously exposed, but with its interests being so vested, no doubt it will survive.\nEven Tony Blair has chosen to sign up as a full member!\n\n\nFor a publication that prides itself on being cutting edge, The Economist is certainly behind on this one. \"Facing mounting lawsuits, Catholic dioceses turn to bankruptcy.\" Editors, can I clue you in on something? The first bankruptcy filing in the U.S. took place in Spokane, Washington, in 2004, which is nearly seven years ago. Milwaukee is now the eighth diocese in the U.S. to seek legal financial protection. I'd simply suggest that you take a look at your headlines before you publish them to make sure they at least sound up-to-date.\n\nRobert North\n\n@curates egg; ah yes the church did systematically hide these abuses. You can start with the current pope no less for an example.\n\n\n@ the sovereign\n\nunless your dan brown then you know that jesus died as a 33 year old virgin\n\nRobert North\n\n@radwrite: Actually I find your post incredibly offensive, and dismissive towards those who have been vitims of the churches crimes, the fact is that these abuses of minors, these sexual violations stand on their own. The church must be held to account, they are not above the law.\n\n\n''I want to find a way to hurt you. \"\nNot really at all.\nThe institution just needs to be abolished, not ''hurt''.\nAfter all, why does one need to be a member of an institution in order to be a 'Christian'?\nMuslims for example, don't need such institutionalisation, and many obviously lead religious lives. Why do some Christians feel that such props are essential to their religiosity?\nI don't understand at all how such need is 'religious'.\n\n\nChapter 11 verse 8 caught my eye but it more accurately could read chapter 11 verse 9, with more on the horizon. The first diocese to file bankruptcy was Portland Oregon in 2004 followed by Tucson, Spokane, San Diego, Fairbanks, Society of Jesus Oregon Province, Davenport, Wilmington and Milwaukee. The decision to file Bankruptcy by Dioceses and Religous Orders is a unique business and management tactic for a note for profit business. If the past is predictor of the future, what is still coming will be larger than the Exon Valdez or BP Gulf disasters. Ireland now knows its history of priest child abuse, the United Kingdom is awaking, Belgium has opened her eys and Germany with the Popes visit in September will too awake.\n\n\nProducts and events\n\n\nTake our weekly news quiz to stay on top of the headlines\n\n"}

John Doyle\n    Well, Patricia, we are all different so this is what I did. Maybe it's useful for you?\n    I started over 2 years ago by giving up on sugar. I lost no weight. Then I started my own diet.\n    I have been at it and have lost 20 kilos, or 3 stone. The weight comes off then stalls for a while then weight comes off again. The body occasionally goes into conservation mode and to restart it a fasting day is a good strategy. The main thing is a] to get the appetite under control and b] to avoid snacking between meals.\n    Start with a big breakfast which may mean waiting till 9 am. I do a high protein breakfast, an old fashioned breakfast, steak and 2 eggs with a tomato and some mushrooms fried in a good tablespoon of organic Coconut oil.The mushrooms soak up the oil. The breakfast weighs about 400grams. You will find you can easily miss lunch as this breakfast stops one feeling hungry for about 5-6 hours. The evening meal is also lighter and I get my greens then. An occasional splurge is no trouble. Generally a loaf of sourdough will last me more than one week. A litre of milk [full cream only!] several days. Avoid all processed polyunsaturated fats, crisco, canola oil etc. Avoid sugar substitutes, learn to avoid sweet foods, eat unsweetened yogurt instead.\n    Eat lard, dripping, duck fat and coconut oil, cream and butter. It may not be what the standard advice is but that advice is wrong.Wild caught fish and grass fed [not grain finished] beef is the choice to make. Also eat fermented foods like sauerkraut, good for the gut bacteria.\n    Try it and see\n  6. Alistair\n    I am 2 weeks into the LCHF diet. Could someone please give me the 'low down' on Tofu and Soya Milk. Can I incorporate them into my diet?\n  7. Philip\n    Tofu is just fine, about 2.5 grams carbohydrates per 100 grams. Its mentioned in the Atkins diet\n\n    Also I make my own [the quality is far better than the commercial stuff] and eat it almost daily.\n\n    Regarding the soy milk, you need to read the label on the container and see how much you can\n\n    allow yourself in accordance with your carbohydrate budget.\n\n  8. Philip\n\n\n\n    allow yourself in accordance with your carbohydrate budget.\n\n  9. John Doyle\n    Here's another warning video about soy\n\n\n  10. Philip\n    Re tofu,\n\n    Watch this for some balance, these arguments , opinions, ideas or whatever can go on forever.\n\n    One good point is the fact that 1300,000,000 Chinese eat the stuff and have been doing so for\n\n    a long time now and without trouble.That should count for something.\n\n\n  11. Zepp\n    \"Evidence suggests that < or =10% of the Asian population consumes as much as 25 g of soy protein or 100 mg of isoflavones per day. The applicability of these findings for making soy intake recommendations for non-Asians is discussed.\"\n\n\n    \"Soybeans also contain potentially healthful compounds called phytoestrogens (also known as isoflavones), such as genestein, diadzein and others that are weak-acting estrogens. Phytoestrogens occupy estrogen receptors and thereby reduce the effect of one's potentially more potent endogenous (made in the body) estrogens. This may well be the reason for the lower incidence of breast and prostate cancer in Japan. However, seen in context with the whole diet, large doses of these phytoestrogens are not as healthy as smaller doses combined with all the other factors found in the traditional Japanese diet.\"\n\n\n    If I was going for soy food I would go for Natto!\n\n\n  12. Philip\n    Interesting references. It should also be noted that the average consumption of tofu in China and\n\n    Japan is about 10 grams ie about two teaspoons per day.These are very small portions in the\n\n    eyes of a westerner and probably have a strong influence on this issue.\n\n  13. Zepp\n    And then whit tasting Natto and loving it!\n\n\n    Then one have to trye the Swedish super food.. surstr\u00f6ming.. its fermented herring.. smells like hell and taste worse then Natto!\n\n\n    I can tell he is doing it wrong.. eat in a clam whit a lot of leek!\n\n  14. Sharon Kenney\n    Ever experienced this before? Been doing LCHF for 2 years. Do it because it's healthy didn't need to loose weight.\n    Two months ago developed diarrhea. After several doctor visits and meds ended up really bad. On the advice of a pharmacist I stopped all dairy. Had ultra sound, blood work and nothing showed up in any tests. The diarrhea let up. Now I was doing a smoothie with kefir and whey protein, using cream and lots of cheese. My question is; could this be caused from lactose or am I\n    allergic to dairy fats as well?\n    I ended up with a specialist who said no one over 1 year old should drink milk but didn't know what was the problem, fat or lactose. He said try butter or cheese in a couple of months to see. Also would goat cheese still be a problem in your opinion?\n    Thanks for any light you can shine on this problem. Really miss my dairy fats.\n    Have had issues with lactose for a very long time, but thought kefir would help that.\n    Reply: #365\n  15. Zepp\n    Im lactose intollerante.. and I dont get diarea.. I get pain in the stommage from to much lactose.\n\n    Probably not allergy against the fat.. some can be allergic against milk protein.. perticaly cow milk protein.\n\n    I agre with that specialist.. milk is for children and calfs.\n\n    Cheese is milk protein!\n\n    It could be som Noro virus too.\n\n\n  16. Sue\n    I'm so confused on what I should be eating for calories.\n\n    I started Atkins 2/3/14. I followed the book and lost 6 pounds the first week. 1/2 pound the second and nothing the third and nothing the 4th.\n\n    I had my calorie intake to 1400 and thought maybe it was too high so dropped it to 1200 but no change. I'm eating about 5% carbs, 65% fat and 30% protein.\n\n    I'm 5' 2\" and 58 year old. I don't do much for exercise. Maybe a few walks a week along with normal housework.\n\n    Any help would be really appreciated,\n\n  17. Sue\n    Oh and my weight is 132 and goal 122.\n    Reply: #368\n  18. Zepp\n    And what is your apetite telling you?\n\n    You dont seems to be obese.. then its probably more about getting fitter?\n\n\n  19. Sue\n    No of course I'm not obese and have only been classified as overweight for two days. :) BUT I like to keep around a certain weight and I gain 10 to 18 every winter. Also I had a lot of pain in my body and staying off sugar pretty much controls that.\n    So I can just go by my appetite? Isn't that how a lot of people GOT obese? Ya I'm a tad hungry once in a while.\n    Reply: #370\n  20. Zepp\n    Well healty induviduals supose to have a healty apetite.. its more importante that one eat real food.. for it to work!\n\n    And a ketogenic diet supose to lower ones apetite if there is extra fat stored in the body.\n\n    There are several causes of obesety.. but I dont think that force feeding is one of those?\n\n    Try this one!\n\n\n  21. Sue\n    Thanks for the link. It looks just like Atkins and that's what I'm following. I am eating REAL foods totally.\n    Reply: #372\n  22. Zepp\n    Yes its all about ketogenic or low carb diets.. but it can be good to have other looks at it!\n\n    Heres another one!\n\n\n    And another!\n\n\n    And heres about how it works!\n\n\n  23. Philip\n    Sue, it seems to me that you are eating too much protein. For a body weight of 132lbs you should\n\n    need about 48- 60 grams per day of protein ie 192- 240 calories worth.ie about 15% of your\n\n    1400 calorie intake.\n\n    You can then increase your fat content to up to 80% and this should improve your weight loss.\n\n  24. Sharon Kenney\n    Thank you Zepp,\n    I'm surprised you mentioned Norovirus. Didn't think that could last that long without others getting it too.\n    So far without any dairy fat or protein I'm good. Some day I will get the courage up to add butter or cream to my diet again. Until then I use other healthy fats. I may try goat cheese sooner.\n    Thanks again,\n    Reply: #375\n  25. Zepp\n    Try Coconut oil.. its easely digested and dont need any bile for uptake!\n  26. Sue\n    Thank you very much Philip and Zeppo. :)\n  27. shane\n    Ive been doing strict paleo diet now for over a month with Sundays as my only day to have carbs. I'm not losing weight. I'm not having dairy either.my typical day i have a protein shake with 1 tbls spoon of raw almonds bfast. and then lunch and dinner is a lean protein veggies steamed or salad (lettuce and tomatoes oil and vinegar ) and maybe sliced avocado. when im hungry ill eat only approved paleo food Ive cut out my apple daily as well. i sleep 10hours a day and work as a bartender witch is physical. no extra exercise. any suggestions. Again no butter no cream no cheese I really don't know what else to do. i feel as I'm doing everything correct water,lean protein steamed veggies little high fats, if i'm hungry ill eat but not in excessive amounts.\n    Reply: #378\n  28. Zepp\n    Eh.. what about real food for a change?\n\n    Try it.. its not dangerus and one get satisfyed!\n\n\n    If you gonna burn fat you need to eat fat.. make fat your main source of energy.\n\n  29. shane\n    OK after reading the above attached link I pretty much eat that way every day( hence my frustration ) minus any eggs or dairy ) ( i guess there's dairy in whey protein. Lean meats, plenty of veggies and salads,water,and again i eat till I'm full. i chose to go Paleo because i wanted to get my body and mind back to basics and for health reason.The only thing I got out of the article was to add some butter or cheese and i rarely eat eggs unless there just covered in cheese and even then kinda yuck! I guess the most frustrating thing is Ive watch all the diet doctor videos,changed the way i eat,i understand the concept,my above first post is exactly the way i live every day except a bad meal on Sundays my cheat day. I thank you for the time in responding to my above post but I'm sorry Im still frustrated. Thanks Shane....\n  30. Trent Black\n    I have a whole different take on this. If you are burning FAT as a body fuel, your blood sugar will be at a constant level. No up and down like on a carb diet. So there is no hunger. So why is there the panic about eating, and what to eat, and all the foods you can have? That is a carry over from the carb days. If you are short of fat in the diet or blood, as a body fuel, you burn body fat. Just be sure to take nutrients. Learn not to eat every often. People who fast then go low carb, find that meal times is a HABIT. After 3 days of fasting, they find they don't even like food that much.\n\n    Many on Atkins go crazy on the protein, cause they carry those carb eating habits into the ketosis world. We run into a lot of issues on high protein diets. It usually starts with some nasty charlie horses, then gets worse. We try to stick to fats. Learn NOT TO EAT. Skip meals. You are not hungry, so stop eating. That panic of being hungry is from the carb diets.\n\n    REMEMBER, you eat for 2 basic reasons: Nutrients and Body Fuel. You don't need that much in body fuel, anymore.\n\n  31. Denise Butler\n    Hi there,\n\n    I am studying a postgraduate certificate of nutrition in Australia, and I read through the textbooks we are assigned and it is all \"eat lots of grains and cut out the fats\". I have to do a report on Obesity and Inflammation leading to chronic disease, with recommendations on how this can be approved. Are there any fantastic peer reviewed journal articles, reviews or meta analysis of LCHF and the benefits to reduce weight and inflammation from scientific journals that anyone knows of? Something really current would be fabulous. I may be going out on a limb as far as the establishment is concerned, and I am not sure how my report will be received, but if I can back it up with evidence, then I may be okay.\n\n\n  32. Zepp\n    As a student I think you can read those links here.. and find what you need!\n\n\n    But.. I think its like Taubes says.. we realy dont know that much!\n\n\n    And everyone cherrypicks what they belive in.. its the same for us!\n\n    That with grains I think is that whole grains is better then flour/sugar.. not cutting flour.. but that was never tested!\n\n  33. Bernie Byerrum\n    I have had 2 heart attacks 2 years ago and triple bypass surgery. and a few months ago I had a defribrillator put in . After all that, is the LCHF diet ok for me? Also I am diabetic.\n    Reply: #384\n  34. Zepp\n    Well, for your diabetes it is the best diet plan.. and your CVD is probably be cause of that!\n\n    You have to make a smoth transitation.. and check your other values in the mean time!\n\n    First you get transitiation problems.. feel awful.. perticaly the first month.. then it lightens up.\n\n    And in the meantime ones blood work can get beserk.. and stabilise to the better after a wail.\n\n  35. Susan\n    I subscribe to Diet Doctor and I find it all fascinating and the best part is that it makes sense.\n    I belong to a hiking group and was talking about the LCHF lifestyle with several of my fellow hikers. I was told vehemently that LCHF is very bad. That two people they knew lived that lifestyle and they both died from liver cancer.\n    Is this possible? That LCHF could cause cancer?\n    I was hoping to post this privately as I do not want to put anything negative on such a great site, but I can't find a way to do so.\n    I'm hoping you can set my mind at ease.\n    Thank you\n    Reply: #388\n  36. Steve\n    My daughter (30 YO) is getting heart palpitations from a low carb diet. Can you tell me what causes this and how to fix it? Many thanks\n    Reply: #387\n  37. Zepp\n    Its comon transitation problems.. new fuel for the heart!\n\n    And salt defiency is altso comon.. take salt in a glas of water and drink it.. if its gone.. then it was salt defiency!\n\n    Another salt that one lose in the begining is magnesium.. its needed for muscles to work properly!\n\n\n  38. Zepp\n    I can asure you that one can fetch almoste any sort of diseases on a LCHF diet.. or any other diet.. except in the case of LCHF.. one probably dont get diabetes!\n\n    Its funny.. that four letters make cancer in the liver??\n\n    I know peopel that died.. and some did eat LCHF.. should I blame LCHF for that?\n\n    One dont get cancer by eating real food.. but one can get cancer (any sort).. despite one eating real food!\n\n  39. Kate\n    I have been doing this LCHF for about a month and i lost 1.5 then picked it up. Constipation is a problem. This is what i eat-\n    breakfast - 1 egg, cheese, 1 piece salami\n    snack -1/2 cup greek yoghurt and a little cream in t\n    Lunch- chicken thigh, some cabbage, broccoli, green beans, cheese, brussel sprouts\n    supper - same as lunch just change the meat.\n    Can someone tell me where im going wrong please :-)\n    Reply: #390\n  40. Zepp\n    Constipation is one of the beginners side effects.. its becuse one dont eat any waist to make the bowel movments.. ad some phsylium seeds and its gone!\n\n    Wath a f**k.. why should people stick to this chicken thights.. let those calorie banting people have there chicken tights alone.. eat proper meals.. eat somthing with fat to it.. like entrecote.. or pork!\n\n    Eat your pork with the rims on it!\n\n    It supose to be a high fat diet.. then one dont eat that much of chiken tights.. becuse there are not that much of fat in those.. one nearly avoid chicken tights.. its not high fat.. one eats pork or entercotes instead!\n\n  41. Kate\n    Thanks for the reply. So im not eating enough fat? Ive now cut out the yoghurt and eating 2 scrambled eggs in morning rather. But I read on your site that i need to have 20g carbs. If I have 1/2 cup broccoli/ 1/2 cup cabbage, 5 green beans and 2 brussle sprouts (according to my calculation) that is roughly 20g carbs. Is that correct?\n    Reply: #392\n  42. Zepp\n    You dont need any carbs.. but you probably need some of the vitamines and minerals in those veggies.. and it becoms a more pleasent meal!\n\n    And on top of that.. try to be as normal as posibly.. eating as normal meals as posibly.. becuse its more about a life style that could last!\n\n  43. adriana\n    Dr.Eenfeldt , no caso de hipoglicemia , qual carboidrato usar?\n  44. Colin\n    I have been on the low carb diet for 15 weeks . I lost 14lbs in the first 10 days and have lost little since. I am 6 foot 4 inches and started at 19 stone. I am now 17 stone 12 lbs. I had carb flu for 4 weeks but do not struggle with the diet now. However lose little weight. My main cheat is white wine. I used to drink 2 or 3 cans of beer most nights and crisps, but have cut that out.. I am 59 years old and am active. On these forums I have heard it is good to fast and also heard not to..\n    I am positive about the diet ,but am on a plateau,also I notice my libido is low. I never thought I would stop ,but I am thinking of it. any ideas?\n    Reply: #395\n  45. Zepp\n  46. J.F.\n    I have been exploring your blog, and find the LCHF fascinating. I have actually started to apply some of the concepts to my diet. However, and perhaps I missed it, I am curious to find out what constitute (%cal or gm/day) constitute a low carb diet or a ketotic diet?\n\n    Thanks in advance.\n\n    Reply: #399\n  47. Martin\n    Is a cholesterol test result different if it is done after fasting overnight or if you have just had a high fat breakfast?\n    Reply: #398\n  48. Zepp\n    Yes it is.. becuse if you have eaten.. then it is the meal one measure!\n\n    And perticly if one have eaten a high fat brekfast.. then it is the fat and cholesterol frome the meal.\n\n    The thing one like to know is your fasting state.. its more static and tell something about your blood lipids as healt markers.\n\n  49. Zepp\n    Just start eating real food.. less carbs more fat.. and your demand of proteins!\n\n    That there is moste sure to say is that one need 1 gram of protein/kilo a day as minimum.\n\n    Carbs as lite one can.. or like, the rest is fat.. for energy!\n\n    But such explanations is litle over the head for moste people.. so I provide a good link!\n\n\n  50. rho\n    I have been on this eating plan since March 1st and have not seen any weight loss. My total carbs are under 40 per day, with all coming from veggies and nuts so net carbs are lower, fat around 100g. I work out about 5 days per week, some jogging and some weight baring. I drink 100 oz of water per day and take in little sodium. What am I doing wrong???\n    Reply: #401\n  51. Zepp\n    You are not doing anything wrong.. you are changin fat for muscles!\n\n    At least I think it is this you aim at?\n\n  52. Martin\n    I became interested in LCHF diets whilst I was researching solutions for candida. I do not not have nor have I ever had a weight problem. I was recently diagnosed with candida in my ears and have found that prescribed ear drops are not a permanent solution.\n\n    Having read extensively about LCHF diets but I have found little evidence of curing candida by following a LCHF diet.\n\n    Reply: #403\n  53. Zepp\n    Well mayby candida in your guts then.. but on the skin I dont think it have any effcts?\n\n    Its a yeast fungus and we all got it in guts and on ouer skins.. but other mekanismes do control it.\n\n    It doesent like a sour environment.. like if one got plenty of lactic bacterias in the guts.\n\n  54. Eric Anderson\n    QUestion about diet to reduce insulin and glucose:\n\n    I use HFLC as my diet to reduce Insulin and glucose. Since I get very little glucose and trace amounts of carbohydrates in Cream (Lactose) and eggs (Glucose or glycogen??) would I expect to benifit from the glucose and insulin lowering effects and seeming lifespan increase fron glucosimine supplements? Eric\n\n    Comment seems to work through lowering insulin levels and reduced glucose going into cells. (My insulin and glucose are low and I do not have lots of glucose. So could this help? Why not just eat the cartlidge from the cows and pigs and sheep? Is not that as much glucosimine as the supplements?\n\n    A study conducted by scientists from ETH Zurich and other German research centers found out that glucosamine, an arthritis supplement, can extend the lifespan of a mouse by up to 10 percent.\n\n    Michael Ristow, lead author of the study and a professor from ETH Zurich, added glucosamine to the diet of roundworms. They discovered that the supplement increased the subjects' lifespan by five percent. After that, they introduced glucosamine to mice that are 100 weeks old, equivalent to 65 years old for humans. The mice were divided into two groups; one that received glucosamine while the other was fed a similar diet with no glucosamine. Results showed that glucosamine was responsible for the eight percent increase in the mice's lifespan, which is equivalent to at least eight years for humans.\n\n    Furthermore, the integration of glucosamine in the mice's diet showed that the substance acted as prevention for diabetes, shielding the mice from developing this common disease of the elderly.\n\n    Glucosamine is readily available in drug stores as a supplement for arthritis and to help patients diagnosed with joint degeneration. Previous studies also showed that it can delay the growth of cancer cells and impedes the metabolism of sugars.\n\n    Further analysis showed that glucosamine also helps in the breakdown of amino acids for the worms and mice. Amino acids are essential components of proteins, and when there is a low supply of carbohydrates, the body turns to them for energy supply.\n\n    \"This reflects the metabolic state of a low-carb diet due to glucosamine supplementation alone - while these mice ingested the same amount of carbohydrates as their unsupplemented counterparts,\" Bristow said in a press release.\n\n    This shows that glucosamine may be used by humans to induce a low-carb diet while maintaining the carb requirements on a regular diet.\n\n    Further details of this study were published in the April 8 issue of Nature Communications.\n\n  55. Robli\n    new findings appear to contradict LCHF\n    University College of London: Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health: Oyebode O,\n    Gordon-Dseagu V, Walker A, et al.\n\n    \"Conclusions A robust inverse association exists between fruit and vegetable consumption and mortality, with benefits seen in up to 7+ portions daily. Further investigations into the effects of different types of fruit and vegetables are warranted.\"\n    Appears to indicate that more fruit and vegetables (=carbs) provides improved risk for heart disease, stroke, T2DM, and obesity.\n\n    Your comments would be most welcome. Thanks\n\n  56. Sophie\n    I don'T see how this contradicts LCHF. It only says that eating more fruit and veggies is better than eating less fruits and veggies.\n\n    LCHF does not imply not eating vegetables anymore. You can have a produce rich diet that also contains a lot of fat. A high produce diet is not necessarily high in carbs.\n\n    The most important carbs to reduce to follow an LCHF is grains and processed sugars.\n\n    The study did not measure grain, sugar, meat or fat. I don't even see how it relates to LCHF.\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nReply to comment #170 by Zepp\n\nPictures of participants through Gravatar"}

Your teacher\u2019s aide (where applicable)?\n\nThere\u2019s been some confusion among district employees about whether the `other unions\u2019 \u2014 the SEIU and AFSCME, mainly \u2014 will show up to work or stand with the teachers. I can empathize with the confused: I contacted the local SEIU office at least twice, called the Pasadena-based employee hotline, questioned the public relations guy, e-mailed the OUSD rep and got nowhere.\n\nPoor timing, maybe, but there might be another reason: These unions are in a tough spot. They reached agreements with the Oakland school district months ago, or even longer, and guess what? Those contracts include no-strike clauses. This means they can\u2019t legally call a sympathetic strike. At the same time, as the SEIU media relations guy from Pasadena told me (before promising to call me back after he \u201cdouble-checked,\u201d which he didn\u2019t), unions don\u2019t make a habit of crossing other unions\u2019 picket lines. And the Alameda Labor Council supports the teacher strike.\n\nThat might explain why the person who helped me piece this all together was Betty Olson-Jones, president of the teachers union. Or why some classified staff members aren\u2019t getting a straight answer. Tell your members to respect the picket line, and the union \u2014 and the employees \u2014 might get in trouble. Tell them to go to work, and you\u2019re undermining another union\u2019s action.\n\nSo, if you\u2019re an AFSCME member and you ask your leaders what to do on Thursday, you might well hear something like this (says Olson-Jones): Report to work, but if you reach the picket line and fear for your safety, call your supervisor and tell her so. They can\u2019t ask you to put your health and well-being on the line.\n\nOlson-Jones said she has told her members that the classified staff who work on Thursday \u201care not scabs\u201d \u2014 but that her union has encouraged all employees to support the strike in some way.\n\nThis leaves me with a question for union employees in the school district who aren\u2019t in the OEA: What will you do on Thursday? If you decide to work, will it be hard for you to cross the line? Are you at all worried about what will happen?\n\nKaty Murphy\n\n\n  \u2022 Union Stated\n\n    At the OEA emergency meeting, we were told that any member of another union [secretary, janitor, etc] can call their boss and say, \u201cThere is a picket line, I don\u2019t feel safe crossing it. I can\u2019t go to work today.\u201d \u2014- and they won\u2019t be docked a days pay.\n\n  \u2022 aly\n\n    i\u2019m sorry but that is the lamest excuse ever, and if it\u2019s true then OEA better really think about how it goes about getting what it wants- your colleagues should never make you fear for your safety.\n\n    i won\u2019t be afraid thursday, but i\u2019ll feel sad and uncomfortable. unfortunately those emotions don\u2019t override my contractual and professional obligations to our students.\n\n  \u2022 Union Stated\n\n    we were also told not to express any displeasure or anger at our \u201cbrothers and sisters\u201d of other unions.\n\n  \u2022 Jill\n\n    Excuse me? We are being told that students and families can\u2019t be punished for staying away from school because we are allowed to show support as part of some \u201cagreement\u201d between the union and the District, but the \u201cagreement\u201d only goes one way? I don\u2019t think so! I hope that teachers and the families supporting them who are on the picket lines show the same \u201ccourtesy\u201d of allowing staff and students entering the schools to show their suppport, (or lack or support, or just plain being stuck in the middle, or not having a choice but to show up at school) that they seem to expect/demand from the school and District. It is not only wrong for an individual, or heaven help us a child, to be threatened or made to feel unsafe for going to school, but it would be a public relations nightmare for a union that seems to be winning a lot of public support right now.\n\n  \u2022 oakey\n\n    Sure wished those employed by OUSD cared as much about the students as their fellow union brothers and sisters.\n\n  \u2022 Chauncey\n\n    Brother and sisters? Sound like a religion to me.For the Marxist liberals who have eroded Oakland-this was utopia until now.\n\n    The dollar crash even effects the Marxist bunch\n\n    Can I get a witness? Where my brothers at?\n\n  \u2022 starshaped\n\n    Look, no certificated staff is going to be called a \u2018scab\u2019 for crossing the picket line. There really is a lot of divergent information out there. How are they to know if information is not given directly to them by their own union? I would love, love, love if they wouldn\u2019t cross the line but would never assume its going to happen. The same goes for the students. No teacher worth his or her salt, is going to impede a student coming to school. Many parents simply do not have the luxury of getting outside care. What was said at the emergency OEA meeting was that fellow union employees can SAY they didn\u2019t feel safe crossing. We won\u2019t be coming after them with sticks or anything. Jeesh!\n\n  \u2022 localed\n\n    the rumor is that OEA has been pressuring the other unions and suggesting that crossing the line isn\u2019t safe. can anyone from OEA speak to that?\n\n  \u2022 Jesse James\n\n    Having been on strike at least 3 times now, strikes can be quite ugly. Scuffles and vandalism are not uncommon events. At my school, staff has been calling people who cross scabs since September. Other district unions have always crossed. I\u2019ve seen truck drivers turn around but that\u2019s it. I think it has to do a lot with mob mentality\u2013we\u2019ve gotten riled up enough to walk out, why aren\u2019t you? Friendships have been ruined over strikes. It is ugly. And yes, these are the same people who teach children conflict resolution. But as a union this seems to be an, and now, the only, tool with which to negotiate. Is there another way?\n\n  \u2022 Just a thought\u2026\n\n    So, a question:\n\n    How many teachers would stay out to honor a strike by cafeteria workers or noon supervisors or clerks? How strong are those claims of purported brotherhood or sisterhood in this case? Classified staff that stay out will lose a day\u2019s pay, a year\u2019s credit in their state retirement (same as will happen to all striking OEA members) AND the possibility of discipline up to and including dismissal (which WON\u2019T happen to OEA strikers).\n\n    And, by the way, if the OEA strikers are making people feel unsafe at their pickets, they are violating the law. So you want the classified staff to lie to their bosses, or are you going to make them feel unsafe and violate their right to work?\n\n    What does it mean to ask someone making $21,000 a year to lose a day\u2019s pay and take a hit to their retirement? Is it the same sacrifice striking OEA members are making?\n\n  \u2022 Cheuy_Leuy\n\n    If the Alameda Labor Council supports the OEA strike, why didn\u2019t they help take a stand when the other unions negotiated \u201cno strike\u201d clauses? Why would any union allow that to happen to its members?\n\n  \u2022 Frustrated\n\n\n    At drop-off this morning a teacher handing out strike information told me that Thursday is now minimum school day. The district website and strike hotline does not indicate this. Have you heard about this? It makes a difference in terms of after school enrichment activities.\n\n    Thank you!\n\n  \u2022 Steven Weinberg\n\n    Just A Thought #10 is incorrect about the effect of the strike on teacher retirement benefits. Teachers do not lose a year\u2019s credit if they strike for one day, they lose 1/186th of a year\u2019s credit. In addition, if they worked any overtime, such as covering classes during the year for absent teachers or attending paid inservice, that time can offset the deduction.\n\n  \u2022 Ms. J.\n\n    I just wanted to comment that I have not heard ANYONE at my site say anything threatening or unfriendly to members of other unions or dissenting OEA members.\n\n    Of course there may be some of that going on, but what I see and hear sounds like solidarity with a twist of compassion. One OEA member at our site has concluded that she cannot join us on the picket line after having done the retirement math, and I respect her both as a colleague and as a professional. I feel sorry that she has had to make that decision but I do not second-guess it.\n\n    I feel a bit defensive at the tone of #10 and some other comments, but I recognize that the situation at my school might be more peaceful than at others. For my part, I am telling families and my teaching assistant that I will not be here. I am telling them why. I am telling them that there will be school but that most of the teachers will not be teaching. If they want to talk more, I will do that. That is all. I do not think anyone is being made to feel unsafe or threatened here.\n\n  \u2022 Cheuy_Leuy\n\n    @ #10, #13:\n\n    Do you really believe the pensions will be delivered as \u201cpromised?\u201d Consider the following which predicts projected funding levels will be based on future taxpayer revenues at huge levels to even think alternatives will be needed than otherwise stated:\n\n\n    This is even more reason for all who can to support this strike\u2026what really is 1/186?\n\n  \u2022 Sylvia Dillard\n\n    It is unfortunate that a strike is necessary. Our children, the students are the ones who will be adversely affected. Even if there are sub\u2019s to cover classes,(babysitters),the instruction will not be what the teacher has been working on with the students. I support the teachers who have an important job to prepare our students to become productive citizens and they should be more valued than they are.\n\n  \u2022 Starshaped\n\n    I think some people have missed the point, teachers are NOT going to harrass other union workers. The other union workers just have to SAY they don\u2019t feel safe. Those worker cannot be penalized because their health and safety are the primary concern. There may be some teachers that act in an inappropriate manner, but they are in the minority.\n\n    Also, taking a one day strike day near someone\u2019s retirement is not going to make a dent in their STRS. If they have any sick days banked up, that takes care of it. If they don\u2019t, it is literally pennies a day. So the retirement thing doesn\u2019t fly with me.\n\n    Although, it is unfortunate that there are hard feelings and resentment of those who benefit from others suffering, i.e. strike breakers vs strikers, it is going to happen. Any strike breaker has to weigh the benefits of crossing the line with losing face/respect of their colleagues. One would hope that as we are all adults, those hard feelings would be kept to ones self and not used to bully or belittle others. Just a thought.\n\n  \u2022 TheTruthHurts\n\n    Where is the common sense people?! Jesse James in Post #9 is telling what life in the big city is really about. Sure, we\u2019d hope that rifts would heal that people would disagree without being disagreeable, but that\u2019s not reality \u2013 it\u2019s not the truth.\n\n    I pray there is no violence or vandalism, but it happens. Labor strife is not pretty. People who feel all other options are exhausted have a tendency to act out. Me, I\u2019d just quit, but hey, I understand the personal commitment that some feel.\n\n    Fact is April 29th is a WORK DAY. Some will not work because \u201cmy union made me do it.\u201d Some will not work due to \u201cpersonal conviction.\u201d Some will not work due to all kinds of \u201cfear\u201d, justified or not. No matter, grownups are making grownup decisions and are subject to grownup consequences. It\u2019s really that simple.\n\n    Frankly, it begins to sound like whining when people can\u2019t make a decision, stand behind it and suffer the consequences. I know it\u2019s hard, I know it\u2019s uncomfortable, but it\u2019s also life.\n\n    Am I missing something or is it that the truth just hurts sometimes?\n\n  \u2022 Cranky Teacher\n\n    @ Just a thought\u2026\n\n    \u201cHow many teachers would stay out to honor a strike by cafeteria workers or noon supervisors or clerks?\u201d\n\n    While I don\u2019t know what a noon supervisor is, I can definitely say with confidence I would never cross a picket line to shop or work. I have no idea with the overall percentage would be, but I know I\u2019m not alone.\n\n  \u2022 Harlemmoon\n\n    The union ought to consider itself blessed that Tony Smith isn\u2019t inclined to mete out a Reaganesque response to strikers. And to that i say: \u201cToo bad!\u201d\n\n  \u2022 Katy Murphy\n\n    Sorry for the late response. There\u2019s no minimum day tomorrow, according to Troy Flint.\n\n  \u2022 Sad Teacher\n\n    I will be crossing the line tomorrow to help take care of the children who come to school. It is a scary time for them and they need the stability that familiar faces can provide. We are not shutting down a factory here -stopping trucks that deliver car parts is quite different from stopping trucks that deliver student lunches. Being mean to \u201cscabs\u201d who want a day\u2019s pay but who do not want to (and could not) take our jobs is similarly pointless. The union model does not make sense in a profession such as teaching.\n\n  \u2022 Gordon Danning\n\n\n    There are 26,200 air traffic controllers in the entire USA. http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos108.htm#emply. Plus, they need only a bachelors\u2019 degree. So, they were relatively easy to replace. The numbers re: teachers make it impossible to just fire them.\n\n    As for claims that some have made that the district is trying to \u201cbust\u201d the union, well that ain\u2019t going to happen either \u2014 there\u2019s a reason that public employees make up a huge proportion of the remaining union members in the USA.\n\n    So, what say both sides just chill with the silly rhetoric.\n\n  \u2022 Turanga_teach\n\n    I\u2019m an OUSD teacher, and I supervise a large number of paraprofessionals. All of whom were afraid for their jobs after getting an insanely overblown release on OUSD letterhead which indicated that disciplinary actions (including the actual word \u201ctermination\u201d) could be taken against people who don\u2019t show. It made the union letter on school conditions Thursday look like we were promising the children milk, cookies, and one-to-one math instruction if they showed up on strike day.\n\n    This is blatant fear-mongering, unsubstantiated by OUSD\u2019s own adopted disciplinary policies for unauthorized absences. Hyperbole\u2019s not helpful, whatever side you\u2019re on.\n\n  \u2022 recovering socalist\n\n    Since this is an edu bloggie, lemmie say it\u2019s \u201csympathy strike,\u201d not \u201csympathetic strike.\u201d\n\n  \u2022 Katy Murphy\n\n    Whoops. Thanks for the strike terminology lesson, \u201crecovering socialist.\u201d\n\n    Since someone brought up the letter sent by OUSD to classified employees, I thought I\u2019d paste some of it here to you can read it for yourselves:\n\n    It is important for all employees to know that District administration understands that any employee strike puts all employees in an uncomfortable situation. We understand that employees may feel sympathetic toward the cause of their colleagues and want to support them. We hope that all employees also remember that we have moral and contractual obligations in service of students. This brief FAQ is not meant to resolve the uncomfortable nature of any strike, but rather to clarify the legal rights and responsibilities of employees.\n\n    Am I required to work on April 29?\n    Thursday, April 29 will be a work day for all employees. Employees who are absent without pre-authorization will be considered absent without leave and incur associated financial and retirement consequences. In our current labor agreements, we have specific provisions dealing with strikes or work stoppages of other units. All such provisions provide that participation in such activities is subject to discipline, up to and including termination. We understand that you may wish to exercise your conscience by not crossing a picket line, but such a decision will subject you to the consequences indicated. This is not to state that the District has planned any specific action in response to unauthorized absences. It is simply meant to reinforce the responsibilities of employees and our rights as an employer. Again, April 29 is a work day and there is no provision for not being at work other than identified leave policies. We have been in direct consultation with union representatives, including SEIU and AFSCME and are confident that our understanding and our expectations of employees are shared with union leadership.\n\n    What if I\u2019m sick?\n    All employees who are sick will be asked to provide written verification as provided in their labor contract with the District. Failure to do so will be considered abuse of sick leave policies and subject to loss of pay and discipline.\n\n    What if there is a picket line?\n    As with any work day, if there is an obstruction at the work location that makes entry unsafe (not just uncomfortable), we expect employees to call your administrator for assistance and await that assistance in order to enter the premises. If your administrator cannot be reached, the Oakland School Police can be reached at (510) 224-1001 and Custodial Services can be reached at (510) 879-8400."}

His firm, Credit Suisse First Boston, under Ogunlesi's direction, helped AES acquire generation assets from Edison International in California with financing in the $725 million area. Ogunlesi's division helped Texaco and Mission Energy raise about $400 million for Tri Energy in Thailand and worked with the Polsky Group to raise $100 million for the Androscoggin Power Project in Maine. He is also working with InterGen out of the United Kingdom and Hong Kong to finance the Mezhiou Wan power project in China and helping sponsors raise capital for projects in India, Mid-East and US \"It has been a very active year,\" he reported.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The latest development in an already full portfolio of achievement for Ogunlesi is the revolutionary financing arrangements for clients. Helping to make the cost of power more manageable, financing is now more closely allied to the useful life of facilities or plants.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Whereby financing extended to the 10- to 14-year range in the past, Ogunlesi states that financing tenors are more closely aligned to the useful life of the plant or facility in the 15- to 25-year range.

While the Novocaine was doing its magic, Bruce told me he has a dilemma this fall.\n\n\u201cMy wife is Italian. She likes to cook. Every fall I head out into the dunes and gather beach plums for her to make jelly. But this year I can\u2019t find any. It\u2019s crazy. I\u2019ve gone to my favorite spots, particularly the dunes south of Indian River Inlet which are always productive, and nothing. What\u2019s going on?\u201d\n\nI was still thinking about that while I was probing my gums with my tongue.\u00a0 Wanted to make sure there would be the same amount of feeling when he went to work on me as the number of beach plums he was finding: none.\n\nThat\u2019s when he told me about Milt Cooper\u2019s trips to his office. Milt died a while back after more than nine decades of life in Sussex County - most of them outdoors. A hunter, trapper, lifesaving station commander and general bright light, Milt had a lot in common with Bruce who enjoys many of the same pursuits. They had a lot to talk about when he came in for visits. But Milt made it clear he wanted enough Novocaine to cover whatever procedures Bruce planned that day.\n\n\u201cHe would walk in and before he even sat down in the chair he would reach in his pocket, pull out his skinning knife, open it up and lay it on the instrument tray. That knife was sharp as a razor,\u201d said Bruce.\n\n\u201cWhile he was laying it down he would say: \u2018Now listen Doc, we\u2019re not going to hurt each other are we?\u2019\u201d\n\nBruce laughed, but I could tell he knew Milt was serious.\n\nBut, back to the beach plums. I told Bruce I would look into the situation so later on I called JuneRose Futcher on Lewes Beach. JuneRose and her daughter, also JuneRose, make beach plum jelly each fall as a cottage industry. (JuneRose Jr. is also a photographer and will be displaying maritime impressionistic images in an exhibit at The Buttery Restaurant.\u00a0 The exhibit will start with a reception open to the public from 4 to 6 p.m., Sunday, Oct. 20.)\n\nJuneRose told me her daughter was finding very few beach plums this year. \u201cEvery few years there\u2019s a down year and this appears to be one of them,\u201d she said. \u201cShe even went out to Beach Plum Island this year and found little.\u201d\n\nI dug further on the internet. It turns out the extraordinary amount of rain we had this summer - that made the corn crop so bountiful - may have done a number on the beach plum crop. An article on the Cornell University site says beach plums depend on bees and other insects to pollinate the white blossoms that give our dunes so much joy in the late spring. Heavy rains, however, can interfere with the bees\u2019 ability to pollinate. That may be the reason why this year\u2019s crop is so far off from normal years.\n\nI\u2019d be more affirmative with my assessment, but Milt\u2019s spirit may be unfolding his skinning knife and saying: \u201cMake sure you\u2019re right, boy.\u201d\n\nHigh mileage or stupidity?\n\nI turned onto Second Street one evening last weekend and came to a stop behind a car stopped in the middle of the street. Nothing unusual. People often stop to load and unload passengers. A tanned man with a cane unfolded himself from the back seat and walked by my door.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d be moving more quickly, but I\u2019m pretty beat up from football,\u201d he told me.\n\n\u201cWho did you play for?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cUniversity of Maryland and then the Baltimore Colts,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThen I\u2019d say you\u2019re a high mileage human being,\u201d I said as he limped past.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know about that, he said. High stupidity is more like it.\u201d\n\nHe said his name was Vinnie Scott.\n\nYou never know who you will find on the streets of Delaware Cape Region\u2019s towns.\n\nAmerica\u2019s Cup announcer\n\nTucker Thompson, who cut his sailing teeth on the Rehoboth Bay and won the Junior North American Sunfish World Championships one year, recently became a national celebrity as a television commentator for the America\u2019s Cup races off the shores of San Francisco.

{"dataman_score": 2.0, "text": "Malaysia does a good job in branding itself as a nation that hosts one of the world\u2019s greatest landmarks, the KLCC Twin Towers, and the notion that they are \u201cTruly Asia.\u201d\n\nBut that wasn\u2019t enough, apparently.\n\nTimeOut Jakarta Magazine had an extensive list on why people are loving Jakarta, and the 101 reason why people love Jakarta is because:\n\n\nEnough Said, as it says.\n\nBoy, didn\u2019t know it got this far.\n\nYou know, I still believe that a royal love story is meant to be beautiful, or at least be kept that way. It is supposed to be the time when the prince holds the hand of the princess, each with their own horses side-by-side, looking at the bizarrely huge sunset over the windy hill.\n\nBut that was my niece\u2019s Barbie DVDs.\n\nI watched them too many times that I started believing in well, the absolute L word. Well, maybe the happy ending love story only applies to American princesses (ehem, Barbie), whereby the princesses are blonde, owns a huge palace, and is married to a prince that is identical to all the princes in the whole Barbie collection, and has spanish-looking maids (seriously), and has either a dog, or a cat as pets (sometimes even a polar bear), and towards the end, they live happily ever after.\n\nWell, if you turn the globe, right to the area where there is a cluster of these unique-looking islands, and one of them is called Bali, and on top of that cluster, there is a name written called \u201cINDONESIA\u201d, you will find a striking different version from a typical royal love story, with a name that currently sells more than Barbie dolls, Manohara Odelia Pinot.\n\n\nIf you\u2019re an Indonesian, reading this, you are probably bound to hear the M-word everywhere you go. And you probably hold a degree, or a master, majoring in the Manohara tragedy.\n\nIf you\u2019re a Malaysian, where the \u201cbad\u201d prince is from, you have probably heard of Manohara here and there, and probably only be in the foundation, or diploma level of the Manohara program.\n\nAnd if you\u2019re neither Malaysian, nor Indonesian, you probably don\u2019t know a thing about it (or care), except maybe, that she made a return to Jakarta after escaping the Kelantan Prince whom she married.\n\nUnlike Barbie, apparently Princess Manohara was abused (physically, and sexually) by her very own former-prince charming, who happens to be Malaysian, Indonesia\u2019s dearest neighbor (Singapore\u2019s too).\n\nApparently, during their \u201cplaying time\u201d the prince used razors to make cuts on her breasts, and her naval area. People have called the Prince a sadomasochist, or even a psycho.\n\nIn my opinion, he was too sexually creative, and he found the wrong princess to tolerate razors with.\n\nOther scandal, stated by the princess was, the claim that she was often drugged after her meal, to put her to sleep, and not cause a sensation with the media, or the public. There is also a claim that she was injected with hormones to make her gain weight, thus creating an illusion that she was eating well, and content with the life in the palace.\n\nWell, that\u2019s a claim on one side of the story, on the other hand, the Prince, as expected, denied all these allegations, and told everyone that she was influenced by her mother, Daisy, for making up stories to the media.\n\nManohara was in a hotel in Singapore when she tried her last escape. A CCTV camera caught her struggling with the Royal guards who tried to stop her. This caught the attention of the Singaporean authorities, and brought her into their custody. Soon, Manohara was given to the Indonesian authorities, and flown to Jakarta, at last.\n\nThe story can go on, and is still going on, but one thing is for sure, no one is going to leave the court happily ever after.\n\nThough it is important to know who is wrong, and who is right in this incident, it is more important to realize the escalated tension it has brought to the already bruised relationship between the two countries.\n\nPolitics come into play, and Princess Manohara is no blonde Barbie, she used politics as a tool to gain support. Everyone should know how, to a certain degree, nationalistic Indonesians are, though this is a good thing, it brings around a weakness to see things from an objective point of view. (I\u2019m not saying she\u2019s wicked or a liar, I\u2019m just pointing out a weakness in believing things too easily)\n\nThe Indonesian public, of course, showed great support for Manohara.\n\nAfter her tour, visiting plenty of local entertainment gossip shows, and photoshoots, she appeared on a recent demonstration outside the Malaysian Embassy in Kuningan, Jakarta, protesting over the conflict on the Ambalat issue between Indonesia \u2013 Malaysia.\n\nShe said the reason why she appeared on the demonstration had nothing to do with her, and her awful Malaysian experience, but more to the fact that she felt that as an Indonesian, she believes that Ambalat belongs to Indonesia (which it does), and that was it.\n\nTo be frank, I\u2019m not buying that reason. I think that the reason she went there was again, to gain easy sympathy among the provoked Indonesians, and that she wanted to widen her support ground.\n\nThough this may seem smart for many of us, Manohara needs to restrain her silent provocation.\n\nBut what really got Manohara where she is today, was not her strategy, but the mass media hungry for some ratings. During the showcase of Manohara all over television, news stations started relating that story to the abuse of the Indonesian workers (especially, Maids) in Malaysia. That got a lot of the public swayed to the notion that Malaysians = Abusers. This, triggered a support of sympathy for Manohara, plus, to the fact that she is one of the upper class and is seen as a \u2018mascot\u2019 to the Indonesia and Malaysia row.\n\nIf Barbie, a cartoon character, can turn American girls into plastic-capitalists, an abused Manohara + provoked Indonesians, can do much more than that.\n\nWhy do we, as a nation, have a mascot to go against our neighbor? And why don\u2019t we, as a nation, have a mascot of peace?\n\nThat is the Indonesian royal-tale.\n\nManohara, do not join anymore political demonstrations, you looked left out.\n\nPutra Patriot.\n\nHey guys,\n\nThis is my first post after a 9-month break-up with blogs, and basically, writing. (No, I did not get pregnant).\n\nMy return has been slow, and I do apologize to those people that waited for my first-ever post, again. As you can see, this blog is not entirely under me, as I have brought a partner to fill in the social-writing gap.\n\nSince the April elections, presidential nominees have been scouting around for their vice-presidents. Well, I, have been doing the same thing.\n\nYudhoyono, aka, Mr. President, has found Boedhiono. Megawati found the annoying (apparently castrated) Prabowo. Jusuf Kalla found the charming Wiranto. And, I found Niq, the lively person to cheer up this blog from its monotonous nature.\n\nAs usual, I\u2019ll be writing much about my trips (I have been flying back and forth so many times), and my thoughts on the surrounding world, especially on Indonesia. While Niq is going to write almost everything, including very personal cases which I do not dare get into.\n\nMy old blog ( is officially dead, though it still does get good-random traffic rate, so you can check on that if you wish, it contains my previous posts as a newbie.\n\nI\u2019m still Prince Jake, just with a bit more Indonesian flavor, so, in this blog, Putra is ready to serve you, yet again.\n\nAnd Niq, welcome to my world.\n\nProklamasi Putra Saputra\n\nRising from the dead,\n\nPutra Patriot.\n\n\n\nWhat You Say\n\nRSS Viva News Indonesia\n\n\nMust-Check-Out Blogs\n\nDesember 2013\n\u00ab Jun \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nGet every new post delivered to your Inbox."}

Only four other coaches \u2018\u0080\u0094 San Francisco\u2019s George Seifert (3), Washington\u2019s Joe Gibbs (2), Chicago\u2019s Mike Ditka (2) and Miami\u2019s Don Shula (2) \u2018\u0080\u0094 have more than one 14-win season.\n\nThe Patriots had just 10 turnovers in 2010 (5 interceptions and 5 fumbles), setting an NFL record for fewest turnovers in a season. The previous NFL record for fewest turnovers in a season was 12 by Kansas City in the strike-shortened 1982 season. The previous record for fewest turnovers in a 16-game season was 13 by the Giants and Dolphins in 2008. The former Patriots record for fewest turnovers in a season was 15 in 2007 (9 interceptions and 6 fumbles).\n\nThe Patriots had just five passes intercepted in 2010, tying the NFL mark for fewest interceptions in a single season. New England attempted 507 passes in 2010, with just five resulting in interceptions. The other teams to have only five interceptions in a season were the 1960 Cleveland Browns, the 1966 Green Bay Packers, the 1990 Kansas City Chiefs and the 1990 New York Giants.\n\nThe Patriots finished with a perfect 8-0 regular-season record at Gillette Stadium for the second consecutive season. New England has now finished perfect at home five times in team history (2003, 2004, 2007, 2009 and 2010). The Patriots are the only team in the NFL to finish undefeated at home in 2010. New England has won 17 straight regular-season home games, with its last home loss coming on Nov. 30, 2008 against Pittsburgh. The Patriots\u2019\u0080\u0099 17 straight home wins marks the longest current streak in the NFL and the second longest in franchise history, trailing only the Patriots\u2019\u0080\u0099 18 straight home wins from 2002-2005. The Patriots own a 60-12 regular-season record at Gillette Stadium since the facility opened in 2002.\nRead the rest of this entry \u00bb\n\nRead More: BenJarvus Green Ellis, Bill Belichick, Brian Hoyer, Danny Woodhead\nHalftime analysis: Patriots 24, Dolphins 0 at 2:27 pm ET\nBy \u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0\u00a019 Comments\n\nFOXBORO \u2018\u0080\u0094\u00a0Two quarters are in the books here at Gillette Stadium, and the Patriots are in complete command, leading an awful Miami team, 24-0.\n\nBiggest story so far is that Tom Brady played roughly a quarter-and-a-half before getting yanked in favor of backup Brian Hoyer in the middle of a drive, only to be re-inserted briefly later in the half. (It\u2019\u0080\u0099s something the Patriots have done on several occasions in the preseason, testing a players\u2019\u0080\u0099 ability to come into the game cold \u2018\u0080\u0094\u00a0they appeared to do the same thing with Quinn Ojinnaka, putting him in briefly for left tackle Matt Light.) Brady finished out the second quarter for New England, and ended the half 7-for-12 for 123 yards and a touchdown. Most of the other starters have played the bulk of the first half for New England.\n\nEarly on, the Patriots moved the ball without a problem, and have stopped the Dolphins on their only serious scoring opportunity \u2018\u0080\u0094 after a rare New England fumble from Danny Woodhead (that ended a consecutive string of 435 offensive plays without a turnover, a streak that included\u00a0seven complete games), Miami steered the ball down to the New England 22, but Dan Carpenter missed a 40-yard field goal attempt. (The Dolphins would get no closer to the end zone for the rest of the first half.) Other than that, it\u2019\u0080\u0099s been nothing but misery for the Dolphins, who pulled Chad Henne in favor of Tyler Thigpen. (Henne re-entered the game at the end of the first half.)\n\nThe scoring drives for the Patriots have been quick and to the point: In the first, they had a six-play, 47-yard drive (which featured a 19-yard carry by Woodhead on a direct snap) that ended with a 13-yard scoring strike to Rob Gronkowski to take a 7-0 lead. That was followed by a four-play, 70-yard series (highlighted by a 40-yard pass play from Brady to Julian Edelman) that concluded with a one-yard plunge from BenJarvus Green-Ellis to make it 14-0.\n\nNew England added a 28-yard field goal in the second quarter from Shayne Graham to make it 17-0, and to close out the first half, Edelman delivered a 94-yard punt return for a touchdown, the longest in franchise history. In two games against the Dolphins this year, New England has a 101-yard kickoff return for a touchdown, a 94-yard punt return for a touchdown, a blocked field goal for a touchdown and a blocked punt. That\u2019\u0080\u0099s what you call a favorable special teams matchup.\n\nAs for milestones, Gronkowski is two behind the all-time NFL rookie record for tight end touchdowns (he has 10, and the record belongs to Mike Ditka, who had 12). In addition, Patriots rookie corner Devin McCourty had one pick of Henne, putting him one behind the franchise all-time rookie record for interceptions (he has seven, and the mark is eight, set by Mike Haynes in 1976). And Green-Ellis needs 38 yards to reach 1,000 for the season.\n\nRead More: BenJarvus Green Ellis, Brian Hoyer, Devin McCourty, dolphins\nThree miss practice for Dolphins 12.30.10 at 3:49 pm ET\nBy \u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0\u00a01 Comment\n\nThe Dolphins had just three players miss practice on Thursday \u2018\u0080\u0094\u00a0linebacker Karlos Dansby, tight end Anthony Fasano and tight end Lydon Murtha.

Bob McDonnell and First Lady Maureen McDonnell clasp their hands during an event at Saint Joseph School in Petersburg, Va., in October. McDonnell and his wife were indicted Tuesday on corruption charges after a monthslong federal investigation into gifts the Republican received from a political donor.\nPage 2 of 2\n\nThe indictment also says that after being interviewed by investigators, Maureen McDonnell tried to impede the investigation by writing a handwritten note to Williams falsely suggesting that the two had previously agreed she would return certain gifts rather than keep them.\n\n\u00a0Maureen McDonnell's first attempt to obtain help from Williams in December 2009 failed, according to the indictment. Williams allegedly agreed to buy her an Oscar de la Renta dress for the governor's inauguration, but senior staffer for the governor-elect nixed the idea. In response, she sent an email to the staffer that read:\n\n\nMaureen McDonnell told Williams she could not accept the dress but would take a \"rain check.''\n\nVirginia Republican lawmakers were quick to express their support for McDonnell as well as their sadness and disappointment that charges were filed. House Speaker William J. Howell and other Republican House leaders issued a statement calling McDonnell their \"good friend'' and saying they were praying for the former governor and his family.\n\n\u00a0\"We believe in the rule of law and are confident in the ability of our legal system to render the rightful judgment, whatever it may be,'' the statement said.\n\n\u00a0Meanwhile Democrats used the indictments to call for stricter ethics rules for lawmakers. A bipartisan group of lawmakers introduced legislation this year in reaction to McDonnell's gift scandal that would place a $250 limit on gifts to lawmakers. And new Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a Democrat, signed an executive order his first day in office prohibiting gifts to the governor, his family or staff of more than $100.\n\n\u00a0\"This is a sad day for Virginia, but I remain optimistic that we can work together to reform our system in order to prevent episodes like this from occurring ever again,'' McAuliffe said in a statement.\n\n\u00a0The scandal unfolded last year around the same time as a separate politically embarrassing case involving a former Executive Mansion chef who was accused of embezzlement and, in turn, accused McDonnell's children of taking mansion food and supplies for personal use. The governor later reimbursed the state and the chef pleaded no contest to two misdemeanors.\n\nThe fallout seeped into the general election, with McDonnell playing a low-key role in support of Republican Ken Cuccinelli, who lost to McAuliffe. Asked why he hadn't been more visible, McDonnell replied, \"That's a question for the candidate.''\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended Stories\n\nPopular Videos\nAdvertisement - Your ad here\nGet Daily Headlines by E-Mail\nAdvertisement - Your ad here\nNews Videos\nAdvertisement - Your ad here\nAdvertisement - Your ad here"}

A bill to ban handheld cell phone use while driving has passed through the House Transportation Committee.\n\nLast November, Debbie Marie was hit by a truck while walking across the street. \"He hit me and then, I went down,\" she says. \"My life got totally flipped upsidedown.\"\n\nShe says the driver was using his cell phone when the accident happened. \"It takes five seconds to get off the road and do your business. It takes two seconds to lose your focus and hurt someone or take a life.\"\n\nOur Lady of the Lake trauma nurse Katie Sheets says she sees these types of collisions all the time. \"In 2008, nearly 6,000 people were injured in accidents related to distracted driving,\" she says.\n\nSheets heads up a program that warns teen drivers of the dangers associated with talking on the phone behind the wheel. \"Injury is not an accident,\" says Sheets. \"It's preventable.\"\n\nShe thinks a ban on handheld phones will help make the roads safer. \"We need this bill. If people keep both their hands on the wheel, they keep their eyes on the road, they can help prevent injuries.\"\n\nSimilar bill have been shot down during the legislative process in the past, but Marie hopes this year will be different. \"I think its a crime personally,\" she says. \"There's a time and a place for that. Don't do it while you're driving.\"\n\nShe hopes what happens to her, doesn't happen to anyone else. \"It doesn't take but a few seconds, and somebody's whole life will be changed,\" she says.\n\nNext, the bill goes to the full house for debate. Similar laws are already in place in nine other states across the country, including New York and Washington D.C. Learn more about the bill at http://www.legis.state.la.us/billdata/streamdocument.asp?did=752607\n\nIf you want your teens to take part in the OLOL community outreach program to talk about the dangers of distracted driving, contact Katie Sheets at katie.sheets@ololrmc.com.\n\n\nComments News Comments\n\nPost new Comment"}

A couple of points, Stephen.\n\n    The STRATFOR piece raises the question, \u201cIs this simply an innocent relief effort?\u201d It seems to me like it is at least a legitimate question whether, and to what degree, this is also a PR stunt by anti-Israeli forces.\n\n    You\u2019d have to ask Israel why they saw force as important; I\u2019m not saying its legitimate, I\u2019m simply suggesting what their own picture of their national interest might be.\n\n    I think this was designed to back them into a corner:\n\n    Either do nothing, with the possibility that all of the \u201crelief\u201d coming in might not be non-military, or;\n\n    a show of force, the option they chose, which would maintain their hard posture in the region and perhaps deter future attempts at (in their view) sneaking in weapons \u2013 but at the risk of alienating them further from the international community.\n\n    The presence of cameras on both sides suggests to me a degree of PR on both sides. I don\u2019t think either side is wholly right or wrong; but I don\u2019t think we should be crying foul when that ship refused to go to port and be searched \u2013 they knew what they were risking when they made that decision. That leads me to believe they were trying to make a scene, and it seems they are getting precisely the result they wanted.\n\nWhat do you think?

{"dataman_score": 4.0, "text": "Bush\u2019s Brain Forgets\u00a0History\n\nkarlrove 0 Bushs Brain Forgets History\n\nKarl Rove, with his latest Wall Street Journal op-ed, becomes one of the countless political observers to bemoan the excessively lengthy presidential campaign process. He (and everyone else before him) clearly has a point. But he also invokes some familiar and misleading history to make his case:\n\n\nBill Clinton\u2019s October 1991 campaign launch is one of the most overused a misunderstood references employed in political analysis. What Rove and so many others seem to forget is that the Gulf War meant there was almost no presidential politicking from the fall of 1990 \u2013 when the troop build-up in Saudi Arabia began \u2013 until months after the March 1991 end of hostilities, an event that caused President George H.W. Bush\u2019s approval rating soared to 91 percent.This meant that the biggest names in the Democratic Party back then \u2013 Bill Bradley, Al Gore, Lloyd Bentsen, Dick Gephardt, Jay Rockefeller, and others\u2013 all passed up the chance to run, calculating that Bush was unbeatable. Only one candidate \u2013 Paul Tsongas \u2013 jumped in before the late summer or early fall of \u201991, and he was treated as nothing more than a curiosity. Clinton \u2013 and everyone else who ultimately ran \u2013 would have jumped in much sooner had it none been for the Gulf War. But Rove leaves the impression that there was a full-fledged campaign raging around Clinton, and that he waited until late in the game to enter. Not true at all. The late start date to the \u201992 process was a fluke.Rove also forgets that this year\u2019s early start isn\u2019t exactly a recent phenomenon. Jimmy Carter announced his 1976 presidential candidacy in November of 1974 \u2013 earlier than any of this year\u2019s candidates jumped in. What has changed since \u201976, obviously, is that Carter\u2019s early start is now standard. But on the whole, this year\u2019s calendar is not a radical departure from the norm. That Democratic race in \u201992 was largely settled by March, setting the stage for an eight-month fall campaign. This year, we should get a nine-month campaign. They\u2019re both too long \u2013 but we\u2019re not exactly in the uncharted waters that Rove suggests.\n\nFollow Steve Kornacki via RSS."}

Aerial parts used for abdominal pains and jaundice. Fresh leaves used against dizziness and to stimulate the appetite.\n\u2022 In Mali, dried stems are ground into a fine powder, added to food, and used for treating abdominal pains and jaundice. Decoction of fine powder of aerial parts used for treatment of malaria. Maceration of pounded material mixed with oil or water used as a wound healing remedy. (10)\n\u2022 In Bangladesh, used for joint pains, inflammation, diarrhea, fever, boils, and skin disorders. (12)\n\u2022 In Thailand, leaves used as expectorant and antipyretic.\n\nImmunomodulating: An immunomodulating pectic polymer, GOA1, from the aerial parts of Glinus oppositifolius was shown to induce proliferation of B cells and secretion of IL-1\u00df by macrophages. (2)\nFree Radical Scavenging / Antioxidant: Study showed Glinus oppositifolius scavenges free radicals and reduces lipid peroxidation, ameliorating the damage imposed by oxidative stress in different disease conditions. It serves as a potential source of natural antioxidants. (3)\nAntifungal / Larvicidal / Molluscicidal / Antioxidant: In a study of 78 different extracts from 20 medicinal plants from 14 plant families, G oppositifolius was one of three plant extracts that gave positive responses to all four tests \u2013 antifungal, larvicidal, molluscicidal and antioxidant testing. (4)\nAntifungal / Larvicidal: A DCM-extract reported to be fungicidal against C. albicans and larvicidal against Anopheles gambiae and Culex quinquefasciatus.\nMolluscicidal: Mollusicidal activity has been demonstrated against Biomphalaria glabrata, B. pfeifferi and Bulnus truncates.\nHepatoprotective: Study evaluating the methanol extracts of Glinus oppositifolius and T decarndra against paracetamol induced liver damage in rats concluded that both plants significantly restored altered biochemical parameters towards normal. (5)\nAntimicrobial: Study evaluated aqueous and ethanolic extracts of leaves, flowers and stems for secondary metabolites and antimicrobial activity. Antimicrobial activity was significant in the stem, leaf, and flower samples, the activity attributed to saponins. (8)\nBioactive Pectic Polysaccharides / Complement Fixating: Study of water extract of aerial parts isolated two pectin type polysaccharides, GOA1 and GOA2. Results showed potent dose-dependent complement fixating activities, and induced chemotaxis of macrophages. (10)\nAntioxidant / Antidiabetic: Study evaluated the antioxidant and antidiabetic potential of a methanolic extract of Glinus oppositifolius leaves in alloxan-induced diabetic mice. There was dose-dependent reduction of blood glucose. DPPH radical scavenging assay activity was greater than 1000 \u00b5g/ml ascorbic acid. Results showed the methanolic extract to possess moderate antioxidant activity and significant antihyperglycemic activity. (11)\nAnalgesic / Anti-Inflammatory: Study investigated G. oppositifolius methanolic extract for analgesic activity using acetic acid induced writhing and tail immersion test and anti-inflammatory activity by carrageenan induced paw edema testing. Results showed central and peripheral analgesic and anti-inflammatory activity. (12)\nHepatoprotective / Aerial Parts: Study evaluated the hepatoprotective effect of an ethanolic extract of aerial parts against paracetamol-induced hepatitis in rats. Treatment with the extract showed dose-dependent reversal of the altered levels of biochemical markers. (13)\nImmunomodulating / GOA2 Peptic Polymer: Study investigated the structure and immunomodulating properties of peptic polymer GOIA2, previously isolated from G. oppositifolius. Enzymatic treatments yielded GOA2-I, GOA2-II, and GOA2-III. On testing, GOA2-I showed significantly greater effects than native GOA2m and also exhibited more potent intestinal immune stimulating activity.

{"dataman_score": 4.0, "text": "FULL TIME: Shakhtar Donetsk 1-1 Manchester United\n\nNot a classic, but United are a point nearer the knockout stage after a staunch if unimpressive display. They lead the table after a couple of games on goal difference from their hosts. David Moyes would have taken that at the start, no?\u00a0Especially with the heat being turned up across Manchester after this.\n\n\n90 min +2: Jones replaces Welbeck. There go the goalscorers!\n\n90 min +1: Bernard comes on for Taison.\n\n90 min: Ferreyra replaces Luiz Adriano. Van Persie wins a corner down the right, and takes it himself. Pyatov punches clear, albeit not in the most convincing manner you'll ever see. There will be two added minutes of this.\n\n89 min: Shakhtar are with the ball, but going nowhere, United keeping a strong shape. Evra creams a clearance down the left. Van Persie is so close to breaking clear, but Rakitskly is over quick to bundle the ball out for a throw. Can United nick this?!\n\n87 min: A wee bit of relief for United, with Rafael dancing down the right. But there's nobody in the middle, and Pyatov claims. Van Persie's opportunistic brilliance aside, United have done nothing up front in this second half.\n\n85 min: This is all Shakhtar. Cleverley's clearance is charged down by Ilsinho. The ball's fed to Luiz Adriano down the right. He can't get a shot in from a tight angle, so lays off to Taison, romping along the byline. Taison skelps a shot goalwards. It twangs off Smalling and nearly loops into the top right, but de Gea tips over. Two corners and one Alex Teixeira header later, the keeper can mop up the danger. United are hanging on here.\n\n84 min: Ilsinho replaces Fernando.\n\n81 min: Srna blooters a low cross through the United area from the right. Valencia clears. Giggs gives the ball away in the middle, it's like Fellaini never left. Teixeira loses control as he attempts to run at United again. United need to clear their heads, they're not in control of themselves or this match at the moment.\n\n79 min: The Shakhtar tails are up now. United can't get hold of the ball at all.\n\n76 min: GOAL!!! Shakhtar Donetsk 1-1 Manchester United (Taison)\n\nIt's not a knockout blow, but it's scored by Taison, so. Rakitskly really has repaid his moral debt for United's goal now. He bursts down the left and fires a low cross into the area. Vidic intercepts, but his clearance is awful, the ball passed out to Taison, eight yards out and bombing in from the left. Taison positively roofs the shot. It was straight at de Gea, but the keeper had absolutely no chance whatsoever of saving that point-blank blast.\n\n\n74 min: The crowd, to their immense credit, are keeping the atmosphere bubbling away, leaping up and down in rhythm of their own songs. Whether their team have as much energy left is a moot point. De Gea has had nothing to do this evening.\n\n71 min: Taison is this close to bringing down a long ball on the right-hand edge of the United area. Smalling wasn't sure what was going on there, but the bounce is kind. United flood up the other end, Rafael making ground down the right. He pulls a low ball inside to van Persie, who feints to the left, then takes a touch the other way, firing s a clever reverse shot towards the bottom-right corner. His switch would have beaten the wrongfooted keeper, but Rakitskly is in position to block the low shot. That's marvellous defending, saving what looked a certain goal, and as such he's repaid his moral debt for his role in Welbeck's goal.\n\n68 min: Srna ghosts past Welbeck down the right. In good space, he hoofs the ground instead of the ball, and for a second looks to have seriously damaged his leg. Sure enough, he's up and running within a minute, and is a 10-1 outside shot to pick up the best supporting actor award at the 86th Academy Awards next spring.\n\n66 min: The dismal Fellaini is replaced by Giggs, who comes on for his\u00a0145th appearance in the Champions League. He's now number one in the all-time list, edging past Raul.\n\n65 min: No worries for United, as Srna blasts a witless effort straight into the wall. Captain's prerogative, and all that, but what eejitry.\n\n64 min: Vidic is booked for taking down Douglas Costa in the rugby union style, 20 yards from goal. He can have no complaints about that, what a preposterous challenge. And a free kick in a very dangerous position.\n\n63 min: For the xth time this evening, Shevchuk finds himself with space and time down the left. His low cross evades everyone.\n\n62 min: Fellaini is booked for a late clip on Taison. He goes through the motions of looking shocked at the decision, but you can tell he's not really feeling it. He's having a bit of a shocker, but then you can't complain too much given that assist, so it's been swings and roundabouts for the big man.\n\n61 min: United are taking the sting out of this game magnificently at the moment. Nothing is happening, and it's through design rather than luck.\n\n58 min: United's first period of decent possession since the restart. Carrick keeps things going metronomically, down the left and then down the right. Eventually the ball's sent back to de Gea by Fellaini, the keeper launching long. There goes that, but a big chunk has been taken out of the clock, and Moyes will be happy enough with that.\n\n55 min: Fellaini, his superb work for the goal aside, has been poor for the most part this evening. He again concedes possession cheaply in the middle, allowing the home side to flood upfield. Shevchuk is once more found in acres down the left. His low fizzer is intercepted by Smalling, who mops up superbly under pressure from Luiz Adriano.\n\n52 min: Shevchuk is sent scampering into space down the left. He fizzes a low shot-cum-cross into the area. De Gea goes down to claim bravely, taking a clatter from Evra as his left-back makes sure Teixeira doesn't nip in. United aren't seeing much of the ball, though, and that dangerous move began when the scrappy Fellaini gave it away in the middle of the park.\n\n49 min: Smalling shoves Luiz Adriano in the back, 35 yards from goal. Rakitskly has an ambitious whack, and it's not half bad either, whipped over the wall and towards the top-right corner. De Gea is following its progress and waves it past the post. Never going in, but not as ridiculous as it seemed when Rakitskly was stepping up.\n\n47 min: Pyatov lingers with the ball at his feet, nearly allowing van Persie to whip it from his toe. The keeper manages to dance his way out of trouble, but only just. The home side go up the other end, Fernando nearly slipping Luiz Adriano free into the area, but Vidic steps in to intercept at the crucial moment. A lively, open start to the half.\n\nAnd we're off again! The home side get things underway for the second time. No changes. Can United become the first English team to beat Shakhtar on their own turf in European competition?\u00a0\"When Ferguson retired, there was talk about how a generation won't have known Manchester United with another manager,\" begins Jaker Ahmed. \"I'd argue there's a smaller number who also won't have first-hand reference of United's claim to be a club that plays attacking football. It's arguably been for a decade or so that United, generally, have served up tired, soulless football by means of entertainment. Even taking into account the Ronaldo team, you could reason that they only played consistently entertaining football in the season before United won their last Champions League. Otherwise, by and large, it's been boring. And it looks like that reign will continue under David Moyes. So far what his Manchester United teams have served up has been pretty shoddy. Oh for the days even neutral commentators had to agree that Manchester United's football was swashbuckling, and the like.\"\n\nHALF-TIME ADVERTISEMENT:\u00a0Daniel Harris, a name you'll recognise from this here e-rag, has penned a wonderful book on United's 1999 treble season:\u00a0The Promised Land: Manchester United's Historic Treble. A must read for fans of the club.\n\nHALF TIME: Shakhtar Donetsk 0-1 Manchester United\n\nAs the whistle blows for the interval, United had eight players in their own area, and another couple very close to it, the home side pushing the visitors right back. Whether this what-we-have-we-hold tactic is the best idea remains to be seen, but United's defence has held up pretty well for the first 45 minutes, and as things stand they're on course for a clear lead in the group.\n\n44 min: Pyatov launches a long hoof upfield. Smalling dummies it back to de Gea; calm play, though he was suddenly spooked by the presence of Luiz Adriano, who he'd failed to notice lurking on his shoulder. The striker was this close to nipping in to intercept. United breathe again.\n\n42 min: A lot of the ball for the home side. United seem fairly happy to sit back and soak it all up.\n\n39 min: Teixeira has a dig from distance, but pearolls the ball straight at de Gea. Very poor. The move started with Fellaini dawdling around in the centre circle as though he was the next Beckenbauer, before being stripped bare by Taison. I'd expect Moyes to have a little chat with him about that during the break, it's not time to get the cigars and brandy out yet.\n\n38 min: Van Persie attempts to crowbar Shakhtar open down the right. He nearly sashays through but has to settle for a corner. Smalling wins a header, but Hubschman eventually clears.\u00a0\"Moyes will never be another Ferguson,\" suggests Adam Hirst. \"He doesn\u2019t even seem to realise that United are not supposed to try and score in Champions League group away matches.\" He's here all week, ladies and gents, try the\u00a0varenyky.\n\n36 min: Valencia shoves Shevchuk in the throat, near the left-hand corner flag. It sounds worse than it actually is, though it is a free kick. The ball's whipped towards the near post, where Vidic wins a header and Carrick, after a fashion, blasts clear. United looked unsure of themselves just before the goal, but they've visibly grown in confidence since.\n\n33 min: The referee's determined to keep his card in his pocket. First he had an excuse to book Fellaini, who clipped Teixeira's boot with a high prod, then should have cautioned Srna, after the Shakhtar captain tripped Welbeck as the striker looked to break quickly upfield down the left wing. But nothing is flashed.\n\n31 min: The first display of frustration by the home fans, who whistle in the 'Frustrated' style as United ping the ball around the middle of the park, keeping possession and causing strife their only aim. Their plan is working well.\n\n28 min: Douglas Costa draws three United defenders towards him before releasing Srna into acres of space down the right. The resulting action involves the worst attempt at a cross in the history of Association Football and a big red embarrassed face.\n\n26 min: Free kick to Shakhtar down the right. Srna whips a low ball into the box. Teixeira's shot is deflected out for a corner. Two set pieces later, United eventually bundle clear. The home side aren't creating much from these corners, but United don't look wholly comfortable in dealing with them, either.\n\n23 min: The home crowd haven't lost faith since the goal. The atmosphere is blistering.\n\n20 min: A decent response by Shakhtar, with Shevchuk faffing around down the left to win a corner. Again United fail to deal with the set piece. Srna attempts to sweep home, ten yards out on the right. Carrick blocks. Rakitskly attempts to make good, but can't get a shot away. Finally Teixeira slaps a hopeless effort miles over the bar for three of the rugby points.\n\n17 min: GOAL!!! Shakhtar Donetsk 0-1 Manchester United (Welbeck)\n\nDavid Moyes is off the bench and punching the air as United take the lead! Welbeck snaffles a loose ball in the six-yard box, teed up by the clumsy Rakitskly, and sweeps home. The defender, falling backwards by the right-hand post, was forced into that ridiculous error after Fellaini bustled magnificently down the inside-right, clipping the ball into the danger area after powering past Hubschman.\n\n\n15 min: United nearly add insult to injury by going up the other end and scoring. But not quite. Welbeck powers down the centre and nearly breaks into the area, but the ball clanks off his shin on the edge of the area and away from bother.\n\n14 min: Shakhtar should have had a penalty here. After a period of pressure, balls flung into the area from each wing, the home side win a corner down the right. United can't clear the near-post set piece, and the ball's loose around the penalty spot. Alex Teixeira rushes in from the inside-right position, and is clipped on the ankle by the toe of Cleverley. It would have been a soft one to concede - it wasn't exactly a heavy contact - but if the sheepish look on Cleverley's coupon is anything to go by, United wouldn't have done too much complaining had the referee pointed at the spot. An escape.\n\n12 min: Rakitskly embarks on a Power Meander down the left. Nobody bothers to try to stop him until, belatedly, Fellaini comes across to put on some muscle. Rakitskly attempts to release Alex Teixeira but Evra gets a toe in to divert the through ball back to his keeper.\u00a0\n\n11 min: The first meaningful attack by Shakhtar. Fernando dances down the right and slides a ball in towards Luiz Adriano. Carrick should intercept but dawdles and the striker picks up possession. Luckily for United, the ball's swung out to Srna, and then fizzed aimlessly through the box. But that's raised the crowd's temperature on a cold night.\n\n8 min: Van Persie is released by a clever Cleverley ball down the inside right. He takes it down from the skies, shifts it to his left, and blooters a shot miles over the bar, leaning back as he tries to steal a march on Rakitskly, the only Shakhtar defender anywhere near the ball.\n\n7 min: Valencia bursts down the right and feeds the ball inside to Van Persie, who looks to turn Kucher on the edge of the area. For a second it looks like the striker's made himself room to rasp one goalwards from the right-hand edge of the D, but he's crowded out.\n\n5 min: Shevchuck concedes a corner down the right, but the resulting set piece is aimless and easily cleared by the home side. \"Surely with Rooney injured, this was perfect opportunity to play Shinji Kagawa is his proper position, instead of being marooned out on the left wing?\" spits Matthew Wilshaw. \"Instead Moyes has opted for Welbeck who was atrocious against City, a midfield 3 of the mundane Michael Carrick, the promising Cleverly and the frustrating Fellaini and Kagawa say firmly on the bench.\u00a0Juergen Klopp must be loving this, he'll have Kagawa back in Dortmond and tearing teams apart by the end of the January window. And I for one won't begrudge Shinji leaving after the way he's been treated at United.\"\n\n3 min: I should apologise in advance for the lack of player identification. The television system at Guardian Villas has recently been overhauled by a descendant of John Logie Baird, and the definition on this particular channel isn't the best. To the point that the screen currently looks like one of those Eastern European cartoons transmitted by Channel 4 back in the 1980s to fill time when they couldn't sell any ads. I'll do what I can.\n\nThe teams are out! The home side are in their Hull garb, the away team in the all-white of Leeds (well, y'know). The players don't go big on control in the early stages.\n\nManchester United fans! Already missing the glory days of the\u00a0Sexton Ferguson regime? Then why not revisit the old boy's greatest year, the 1998/99 treble season? Mr Daniel Harris, oftentimes of this parish, has penned The Promised Land: Manchester United's Historic Treble. A more lyrical, insightful, witty and evocative text on matters United you'll do well to find, I'll be bound.\n\nThe BIG Rooney story is, of course, that he's not playing. But why, we hear you cry. WHY???????? It's been quite the pre-match affair. First one of the major press agencies claimed he was ill. But United have since confirmed that he's out having taken a knock to the shin in training. It's blown up like a balloon, which can't be good news writes Dr Murray. But United fans need not fret too much; Moyes has just told the Sky Telecast Service that he was going to drop him to the bench anyway. That'll have gone down well Chez Rooney, as the player rubs soothing balm onto his sore leg and throbbing, pulsating, blistering-hot temples.\n\n\"So Rooney's phoned in sick then?\" chirrups Simon McMahon, squinting between the lines and reading exactly what he wants to read. \"How long before Moyes is tempted to do the same?\"\n\nTeam news\n\nNo Wayne Rooney for Manchester United. Nobody's sure yet whether he's ill or injured, or ill and injured. Robin van Persie's back, though, so it's swings and roundabouts.\n\nShakhtar Donetsk: Pyatov, Srna, Kucher, Rakitskiy, Shevchuk,\u00a0Fernando, Hubschman, Taison, Alex Teixeira, Douglas Costa,\u00a0Luiz Adriano.\nSubs: Kanibolotskiy, Stepanenko, Bernard, Eduardo, Ferreyra, Kryvtsov, Ilsinho.\u00a0\n\nManchester United: De Gea, Rafael Da Silva, Smalling, Vidic, Evra,\u00a0Valencia, Carrick, Fellaini, Cleverley, Welbeck, van Persie.\u00a0\nSubs: Lindegaard, Jones, Giggs, Hernandez, Nani, Young, Kagawa.\u00a0\n\nReferee: Pavel Kralovec (Czech Republic)\u00a0\n\n\nAfter the thrashing in the Manchester derby, and a first home defeat against West Bromwich Albion since 1978,\u00a0there's a wee bit of pressure building on\u00a0Manchester United and David Moyes.\u00a0Of course in a grown-up and rational world, there shouldn't be; the man's only been in the job for three months, he's seen his team score four times in the one match they've played in Europe this season, they've put their arch rivals Liverpool out of the League Cup, and they're only three points behind hot favourites Manchester City in the Premier League. But you know how people like to go on.\n\nThen again, Manchester United are Manchester United, the bar is set right up there\u00a0\u261d, and this is where we are.\u00a0Moyes certainly could do with the succour of another three Champions League points, though Shakhtar won't be ready to cough. They've hosted teams from England five times in European competition, and have won four of the matches, drawing the other, most recently seeing off Arsenal in 2010 and reigning champions Chelsea in 2012. They've been struggling in the Ukrainian Premier League this season, by their own haughty standards, but they won their opening fixture in this group, 2-0 at Real Sociedad, and have scored at least once in each of their last 28 games. It's the sort of stern test Moyes could do without.\n\nKick off:\u00a07.45pm BST, 9.45pm local time."}

{"dataman_score": 4.0, "text": "Is this a bolt malfunction? [Archive] - Glock Talk\n\n\nView Full Version : Is this a bolt malfunction?\n\n06-02-2010, 08:32\nI have a Bushmaster XM with the 14 1/2\" inch barrel and the 2\" permanently attached flash suppressor Shorty (not the one listed in the for sale section). I cocked the rifle, fired a round, and then tried to fire a second, and it only clicked. It hadn't chambered a round. It would blow back after the first shot, but wouldn't chamber the next round on its way back into resting position. It would simply slide over the top of the next round in the magazine, sometimes scratching the case slightly, sometimes not touching it at all. I could cock the rifle slowly manually after each shot, watching to make sure it caught the next round, then letting the bolt slap shut the rest of the way, and it would work that way and chamber a round that would fire. But I could never get it to catch the round itself after firing a shot. I tried everything. I made sure the magazines were seated properly. I tried new and used magazines and different ammo including Remington .223 straight out of the box. Same problem.\n\nAny help would be appreciated.\n\n06-02-2010, 11:47\nIt sounds like short stroking, just place 1 cartridge in the mag, chamber and fire.\nDoes the carrier lock back on the mag catch after firing? If not then it is short stroking and not going back far enough to catch the rim of the next round.\n\nRemington UMC and Federal eagle are known to be weak, try Winchester White box (XM193) those are full power loads.\nThere are several things that could cause short stroking, sometimes it just needs to be lubed well but keep the bore dry(no excess oil) If it has an H2 buffer you may want to go to a lighter standard carbine buffer. If the mags are stuffed full there could be too much pressure on the carrier as it slides over, load the mags to the top and remove one round as standard practice. The gas block may not be in line with the port in the barrel and as a last resort the port in the barrel may need to be enlarged, it's easy to do but not really reversible so that would not be the first choice when looking for a fix."}
{"dataman_score": 4.0, "text": "A science blog with Eric Berger\n\nDeep in the ocean floor scientists find life buried for millions of years\n\n\nThere\u2019s a truly fascinating research paper in the journal Science just out today.\n\nScientists have drilled into the bottom of the Pacific Ocean, generally along the equator and into the North Pacific Gyre, to bring back samples of the clay there. They brought brought cores of sediment up to 90-feet deep into the seafloor.\n\nAnd they found life. Lots of it. That\u2019s not surprising, as it\u2019s estimated that about 90 percent of Earth\u2019s single-celled organisms live buried beneath the sea floor.\n\nBut these scientists didn\u2019t just find life near the top of the cores, but deep in them, in ancient sediment.\n\nCalm seas on the equator. (Science/AAAS)\n\nSediment builds up on the ocean floor over time, about 1 millimeter per 1,000 years. So the bottom of these cores represents sediment that tens of millions of years old.\n\nIn their research paper (see abstract) the scientists describe the discovery of bacteria deep in the cores that are still active, if barely. The organisms have enough oxygen to keep their membrane intact (which requires energy) and to keep enzymes and DNA functioning.\n\nHere\u2019s the amazing part: this life is subsisting in sediment that has not received outside food from the world since dinosaurs roamed the Earth, for a span of at least 86 million years.\n\nHere, then, is life previously unknown to us, possibly subsisting at the minimum energy needed for life.\n\nEric Berger\n\n66 Responses\n\n  1. tboyinhouston says:\n\n    More evidence that life is probably everywhere, even on Mars and the moons of the gas giants.\n\n    \u2022 Eric Berger says:\n\n      Yep, I think that\u2019s a pretty good guess.\n\n    \u2022 Good2BMe says:\n\n      Agree. We are foolish to think that intelligent life only exists on Earth.\n\n    \u2022 Riograd says:\n\n      Life is almost certainly going to exist in many places other than the Earth, although its chemical nature could be quite different \u2014 many not largely DNA-based heredity as we have here. Also, it may be much more common to have microbial-based life than complex multicellular organisms that we have here on Earth \u2014 and intelligent life, at least to our level, may be even rarer.\n\n    \u2022 James says:\n\n      I just hope that these bacteria don\u2019t become the creatures that wipe out the human race (after sampling the air and any other \u201cfood\u201d it may come across and become fully active again).\n\n  2. God says:\n\n    I work in mysterious ways.\n\n    Which is why you should not destroy my work.\n\n  3. Jason says:\n\n    Doesn\u2019t this seem like the opening scenes to a movie where and ancient virus is released and 3/4 of the world is turned to zombies?\n\n    \u2022 Redwinger says:\n\n      Just what I was thinking! Even though these scientists could not have know what they would find in there, it seems like maybe they should be working with these cores \u2013 and in future cores \u2013 inside something like a CDC lab. Keep them quarantined until we can know for sure they will not harm not only us, but other species that have arrived/evolved since those times.\n\n    \u2022 Special K says:\n\n      I like that idea.\n\n    \u2022 JohnD says:\n\n      Redwinger, they do something very like that. They keep the core refrigerated and then sample it under sterile conditions in order to prevent contamination of the core and so that they may obtain accurate measurements of in situ pressure and gas concentrations.\n\n      See the IODP website for more details:\n\n    \u2022 wdsheffer says:\n\n      As it turns out, these microbes were responsible for the extinction event that wiped out the last of the dinosaurs. They\u2019ve waited a long time for a new day.\n\n    \u2022 JoeK says:\n\n      Until someone bumbs into the table and the test tube breaks then all at CDC contract the rage virus, then infect the world!! Wow need to plan my survival plan, where will I hold up, will there be anymore survivors?\u2026hmmm\n\n    \u2022 Vern grey says:\n\n      You\u2019ve been watching too many crappy movies\u2026 Zombies? Really?\n\n  4. Radar56 says:\n\n    And the Creationist scientist can claim another victory! An intelligent life form put it there and another drilled it out. re-enforcing proof of intelligent design! Now they can go back into the cave and do more research\u2026\n\n  5. JohnD says:\n\n    Given that we\u2019ve found bacteria in the upper stratosphere and segmented worms two miles deep in the crust, this result does not surprise me very much (though I am eager to see how it will impact xenobiology). As more than one science fiction author was wont to say, life is ubiquitous.\n\n    \u2022 Jim says:\n\n      I have read of mineral deposition\n      based on bacterial activity.\n\n      I have often wondered how the world looks\n      to various organisms. I suspect we are\n      rather slow and uninteresting to a hummingbird.\n\n      But to some of these bugs, we might be\n      as ephemeral as a butterfly.\n\n  6. PDQPete says:\n\n    Ancient creatures buried deep beneath the seabed, hovering between life and death for millions of years, dredged up by venturesome scientists\u2013don\u2019t these geeks read any H. P. Lovecraft? THIS IS HOW THE TROUBLE ALWAYS STARTS!\n\n    \u2022 JohnD says:\n\n      Even worse \u2013 the hole in the ship that they drill through? It is called The Moon Pool.\n\n      We are doomed, doomed I tell you!\n\n    \u2022 richard says:\n\n      Doomed? Possibly, but the evidence is increasing that we\u2019ll be at least zombified. Seriously, this is the most amazing thing that I have ever seen. 86 million years.\n\n    \u2022 bkbirge says:\n\n      I\u2019ve always wanted a pet shoggoth. Garbage collection would be easy.\n\n    \u2022 JohnD says:\n\n      Please remember that, while the sediments have been effectively sealed for about 86 million years, the individual organisms are not that old. Just as is the case with Lake Vostok in Antarctica, which was isolated for some 5,000,000 years, the individuals represent species that have undergone extreme isolation and consequential genetic drift under extreme conditions \u2013 which means that they are likely to be newly discovered species and not the same species as the one first placed into the geologic baggie.\n\n      Given what we\u2019ve learned from other extremophiles, I doubt that we\u2019ll be zombified, except in astonishment over the unique traits found in these species.\n\n    \u2022 Ann says:\n\n      And I\u2019ve just flashed on Tremors.\n\n  7. Hmmmmmm says:\n\n    You\u2019d think after 86 million years they\u2019d find at least one man down there. Or maybe a frog. Tadpole?\n\n  8. Chris Hutto says:\n\n    How is this possible? the Earth is only about 6000 years old, right? Right?\n\n  9. David says:\n\n    Oh sure, when scientists dig a hole in the ocean floor and pull up stuff that\u2019s millions of years old it\u2019s all awesome and wonderful. But when BP does the same thing, it\u2019s an environmental disaster.\n\n  10. wdsheffer says:\n\n    I think George Burns was down there, too.\n\n  11. steve says:\n\n    bring it on! lets see what happens? could go good, could go bad, could be nothing? no matter what, its damn cool! OK all, gotta get back to CERN stuff! later. . . . .\n\n  12. Lou says:\n\n    Not that exciting compared to what I\u2019ve come across\u2026\n\n  13. Saved says:\n\n    Hold on there. That does not point to millions of years but rather sudden catastrophic change brought about by a flood.\n\n    \u2022 JohnD says:\n\n      No, Saved, it explicitly points to millions of years of deposition. If you look at the core samples, you will notice that they show a many different layers in a sequence that is inconsistent with flooding. When you have a flood, you get one big deposit that fines upward. The cores from the North Pacific Gyre don\u2019t do that. Ergo, there is no evidence supporting a flood.\n\n    \u2022 Saved says:\n\n      no John it odes not. I tis impossible for thinghs to exposed for the periods of time and remains survive. This all happened very suddenly so as to preserve what they are finding, not over millions of years.\n\n    \u2022 Glenn Beak says:\n\n      Of course the bacteria didn\u2019t evolve as it was slowly buried under sediment either. The Intelligent Designer created the bacteria that could stay alive for millions thousands of years just so scientists could find it.\n\n    \u2022 JohnD says:\n\n      It is impossible for things to (be) exposed for the periods of time and remains survive.\n\n      Sorry, saved, you are obviously wrong here. Have you never seen a cow skeleton in the field? They last long enough to be buried. The same is true of sea shells at the shore, wood buried in lakes, and many, many other natural remains.\n\n      And, of course, we can settle this via an experiment. And we have:\n      Meyer, C. A., Burial experiments with marine turtle carcasses and their paleoecological significance, PALAIOS, February 1991, v. 6, p. 89-96, published online 1 February 1991\n\n      Denys, C., Taphonomy and experimentation, Archaeometry, Volume 44, Issue 3, pages 469\u2013484, August 2002\n\n      Perhaps the most telling argument against your point of view is also one of the most subtle. When calcium carbonate is buried, it undergoes diagenesis; that is, it slowly changes from being calcium carbonate (limestone) to being calcium/magnesium carbonate (dolomite). This is a chemical reaction, with reaction rates that can be measured in the laboratory. Based on those reaction rates, the sediments must be millions of years old.\n\n  14. drumb47 says:\n\n    Amazing. Further proof that man has only began to uncover the secrets of\n    our earth let alone space.\n\n  15. Hank Jones says:\n\n    Wow, they must be really really hungry. I hope they find a suitable host, and quickly.\n\n  16. exdoublexx says:\n\n    Has anybody tried drilling deep under Katy, to see what escaped?\n\n  17. Dick Hertz says:\n\n    I don\u2019t believe it because according to the Bible the Earth is only six thousand years old. Once gain science got it wrong. Thank you Jesus!\n\n    \u2022 ScientistMike says:\n\n      I can\u2019t tell if you are kidding or not.\n\n      \u201c\u201cYoung Earth\u201d creationists believe in a literal interpretation of the Genesis creation account, and conclude that the universe was created 6,000 years ago. \u201d\n\n      This article is a good, balanced discussion of that concept that shows both science and the Bible can be correct.\n\n    \u2022 Glenn Beak says:\n\n      I saw in a Chron story that a Christian school took a field trip to the deep gulley that washed out in a Richmond subdivision. \u201cI wanted the kids to be able to see the soil layers and just be able to have a first-hand experience of what they\u2019re learning,\u201d was how the teacher explained it.\n\n      I\u2019m sure the teachers parroted the Young Earth explanation for the Grand Canyon forming without millions of years of erosion. It\u2019s too bad a geologist wasn\u2019t there to set them straight.\n\n    \u2022 Eric Berger says:\n\n      A lot of Christian schools teach standard geology.\n\n    \u2022 Glenn Beak says:\n\n      You\u2019re right Eric, but I got Creationist vibes from the quotes. Young Earthers love the idea of fast forming canyons.\n\n  18. Jimbob says:\n\n    isn\u2019t this how the blob started?\n\n    \u2022 Glenn Beak says:\n\n      Where the scientists Steve McQueen and a carload of teenagers in a convertible?\n\n    \u2022 JohnD says:\n\n      No, The Blob came from outer space in a meteorite that was foolishly poked by an old man (after it ate his dog).\n\n      You are thinking of Bug, I think.\n\n  19. Tom says:\n\n    I have never understood how they can claim anything is millions of years old. I know they have all types of tests but if you don\u2019t have something you KNOW is a million years old to start with all is null and void, and who can truly make that claim. Just to be able to go back a few thousand years is pretty remarkable.\n\n    \u2022 JohnD says:\n\n      We know the ages from radioactive decay curves and from other evidence (e.g., known deposition rates, paleomagnetism). These are all independent dating techniques and they all give the same answer, so we can rely on it.\n\n      As to the question of timing billions of years when we\u2019ve only been here for a few million, think of it this way \u2013 you know how quickly something will fall, thanks to Newton\u2019s Law of Universal Gravitation. You can then determine how long it has been falling by how quickly it moves. (As with all analogies, it isn\u2019t perfect \u2013 but it gives you an idea of how it is done.)\n\n  20. They had better stop that seafloor drilling right now before they drill into Earth\u2019s Alien Civilization.\n\n    It is out there. Are you?\n\n  21. Rick says:\n\n    If the Obama administration finds out we can survive on nothing then that\u2019s all that will be left!\n\n    \u2022 PaulP says:\n\n      I hereby nominate the preceding comment as the \u201cNon-sequitor Of The Day.\u201d Congratulations.\n\n  22. Steve C. says:\n\n    It\u2019s indeed fascinating that we\u2019ve found these long-dormant buried bacteria, and it\u2019s a tribute to life\u2019s hardiness.\n\n    That said, I think it\u2019s far more likely that extremophiles evolved from life-forms that developed in much more hospitable environments. Was (or is) there life on Mars or Europa or other nominated contenders? I\u2019d love to find out, but I don\u2019t believe that the presense of extremophiles on Earth says anything reliable about the development of life elsewhere in even more extreme enviroments.\n\n    \u2022 Glenn Beak says:\n\n      I agree, but some extremophiles may be survivors that had the environment evolve around them. It\u2019s possible they took refuge in hot springs and ocean depths while the Earth cooled and became \u201cpolluted\u201d with oxygen.\n\n  23. One definition of \u201cintelligent life\u201d might be the organism\u2019s relative ability to merely survive in a somewhat hostile environment\u2026 why complicate it with this \u201cEinstein\u201d stuff?\n\n  24. NoWhining says:\n\n    Dinosaur poop must be a great fertilizer.\n\n  25. craig says:\n\n    We need to run this by Mick Huckabee for a response. This discovery just does not fit.

{"dataman_score": 3.0, "text": "Author's Note: Hi minna! It's me, Yuki (again!). Here is another fic from me. Sorry if the title doesn't fit the story so much. ^_^. Well anyway, please read and review! BTW, if you have a better title suggestion (Yeah, my title doesn't fit the story too much), feel free to tell me and I'll look at it (Actually, I'll read it and decide). So anyway again, I know you're getting quite bored of what I have to say so I better stop bragging. Last one na lang, PLEASE REVIEW!!!\n\nDisclaimer: None of the GK stuff belongs to me. They belong to GONZO/Hiroshi Yamaguchi.\n\n\nBy: Yuki\n\nA bus stopped near a port where ships are leaving and arriving; carrying thousands of people to different destinations of their choice. Seagulls continued to fly above the ships, glancing down at the huge water vehicles as they passed by.\n\nThe door of the bus opened. A girl stood inside; ready to step out. She covered her eyes from the sunlight, which was trying to find a way to go inside the bus.\n\nRuriko stepped out, the wind carrying her soft brown hair, making it as wavy as a flag. She walked on closer to the only ship that was not crowded. It was huge and clean; sparkling because of the sunlight.\n\n/He really took good care of it\u2026/ Ruriko thought to herself. Before she could still think more, she was pushed from behind and a running Kaoru apologized to her.\n\n\"Gomen, Ikusawa-senpai!\" Kaoru apologized, gaining a smile from the older girl. Ruriko stood up and dusted her clothes. Afterwards, she picked up her baggage and went to her father who was calling everyone's attention.\n\n\"Okay, is everyone here?\" Mr. Ikusawa asked with an old male voice. The group glanced at each other and, after making sure that no one was missing, they nodded to Ruriko's father in perfect unison. The old man then cleared his throat, attempting a continuation of what he has to say.\n\n\"So, let me introduce to you the ship that you will be riding.\" Mr. Ikusawa started, motioning to the ship behind him. Everyone smiled in amusement, admiring the water vehicle. Not wanting to waste anymore time, Mr. Ikusawa continued. \"That ship is NOT in the Ikusawa's property. My friend, who is currently at America, owns it. He left the ship to his son, who was the one who really took good care of it. The boy loves the ship very much so you better take good care of it, okay?\"\n\n\u00a0\"Sure.\" Shun replied, and a lot of affirmation followed from the group. Mr. Ikusawa smiled at them and called someone from the ship.\n\n\"Shinda! Will you come here for the moment?\" Mr. Ikusawa called out. There was a reply from the ship and a lad came running down from it. His silver white hair bounced as he ran, also because the wind was playing with it. His ruby red eyes looked so kind, and everyone noticed one thing about it. He was looking at Ruriko.\n\nShun glanced at his childhood friend. The girl was obviously trying to avoid Shinda's glance. But still, Shun knew that it was something personal, so he decided not to question Ruriko.\n\n\"Okay Shinda, please give an introduction about yourself.\" Mr. Ikusawa told the lad, calling everyone's attention. They didn't bother to ask Ruriko now; that wasn't the right time.\n\nShinda seemed to be quite shy to give an introduction. He seemed to be a bashful type of person; yet, he didn't remove his eyes from Ruriko. He simply stared at her as he spoke, while on the other hand, the girl tried to avoid his glance.\n\n\"Good afternoon.\" Shinda started, greeting everyone and at the same time, calling their attention. Almost everyone was trying to take a glance of the ship, really admiring it and unable to believe that they were going to ride in it. Anyway, after Mr. Ikusawa cleared his throat with meaning, everyone behaved themselves, now listening to Shinda. And so, Shinda continued to speak.\n\n\"My name is Shinda Otoko. I don't think I need to say more because uncle has told you about my ship. Anyway, I hope everyone has fun on the beach. Don't worry, I'll always be at the control room, so you guys can have fun with each other.\" Shinda paused, or probably stopped, indicating that what he said was everything that he really wanted to let them know. Mr. Ikusawa then took over, saying his final farewell to the group.\n\n\"Okay then, I know you know that I'm not going with you. Don't give Shinda a headache, okay? So, have fun, and don't forget to take home some seashells for your parents. So long.\" Ruriko walked to her father and kissed him on the cheek, waving him goodbye. The rest of the group then thanked him again, and immediately ran to the ship with Shun and Kaoru, who seemed to be racing, in the lead.\n\nMr. Ikusawa just smiled, simply standing there and waving his hand until the ship was out of sight.\n\n\nThe whole day was spent. They toured around the ship the whole afternoon, which resulted to fatigue for everyone. By that time, the sky was already black, and everyone was in their room already, craving for rest. But still, even with all the weakness, they probably had the time to chat, since because a night with friends is not complete without midnight bragging.\n\n\"Ayayay, Bancho was really mad when Ukkieya jumped on his head. His face was smashed to his soup, and he came jumping to the bathroom!\" Fei exclaimed, laughing after her sentence. They have been talking about their lunch last time. Kaoru and Ruriko were not present when the incident that Fei has just told happened, because they went to the bank with Ruriko's father.\n\nKaoru's laugh finally faded away. The girl then started another topic of interest, or probably, HER interest.\n\n\"Umm, Ikusawa-senpai, is there something between you and Shinda? Who is he anyway?\" Kaoru asked, shifting to a serious state. Ruriko was obviously surprised to hear the question. She remained silent for seconds.\n\nRuriko, after taking a deep breathe, replied. \"Actually, there was nothing between us, and there will be nothing.\" Ruriko replied. She looked very uncomfortable, as if there was something that she wanted to spill out, but yet, she can't do so.\n\n\"Senpai, don't worry.\" Kaoru told her senior, trying to comfort her. \"If you need someone to tell your problems to, I'm always here.\" She added with a friendly smile. Even if Ruriko was her rival for Shun, she was also her friend; one of the closest friends she could have.\n\nRuriko returned the athletic girl's smile. \"Okay then, I guess I'll let you know.\" Ruriko said, closing her eyes, as if she was trying to recall everything from the past.\n\n\"Shinda is the son of my father's best friend. Since grade school, when Ukiya-kun left, Shinda served as my best friend. He was with me through our grade school and junior high years. He loved to experiment. Sometimes, he would show me his masterpieces, as he called them. He made poison gases, some other kinds of gases and knives. He kept the first knife that he made. The knife looked totally expensive; it was always clean and sparkling. And also, Shinda took care of this ship, which was given to him by his parents when he passed the exam to an expensive and wonderful high school in\u2026 umm\u2026 sorry but I forgot where it was.\" Ruriko grinned, although it was somewhat forced. After sticking her tongue out, she added a continuation.\n\n\"He courted me during junior high, but I, treating him only as a best friend, rejected him. I explained to him, and he said he understood. But yet, he just won't leave me, that's why sometimes, I'm feeling guilty because I rejected him.\" Ruriko paused for long, twenty seconds, her eyes fixed on the floor. She then glanced at the group of girls who were listening to her and said, \"It's getting late. I think we should sleep now.\" After her sentence, she hid under the blankets of her bed, and the others went on to their own sleeping places.\n\nKaoru, thinking that Ruriko wasn't just a friend but also a rival, had a plan in her mind. She was very determined to get Shun that she decided that she shouldn't let the chance pass her by. Smiling at herself, she clicked the light off, making it flicker until the room was in complete darkness.\n\n\n\u00a0Shinda was in the control room as usual. The group was probably eating their breakfast now, while he hadn't eaten even a crumb of bread. But yet, he thought that he shouldn't interfere with the group's fun. He should ask Shun to replace him at the control room for some time so he could eat breakfast.\n\n/Shun Ukiya\u2026 / Shinda thought, the name making his heart beat faster. The owner of the name was his greatest rival for Ruriko; he was the hardest to beat. Completely drowned by his thoughts, Shinda didn't hear the door opening, nor did he smelled the aroma of newly cooked breakfast.\n\n\"We're in a deep thought, aren't we?\" A female voice said behind him, making him leap off his chair. He quickly calmed down when he saw who it was.\n\n\"Kaoru Konoe, right?\" Shinda asked, hoping that he was right. He was familiar with the girl; the one who was trying to take Shun Ukiya away from Ruriko. She would be perfect to make a deal with, but the problem is, the girl might not want to have a deal with him.\n\n\"Yeah, right.\" Kaoru replied, a big grin crossing over her face. \"Well anyway, I brought you some food, obviously.\" She added, laying the tray on a nearby table and pulling it closer. She sat on the couch beside Shinda almost in a jumping manner, making the couch bounce under her bottom.\n\nShinda took the food and started his meal, not paying attention to the door, which was left open and has begun to make noise in the room. Kaoru just stayed put, watching the white-haired lad as he stuffed a spoonful of fried rice in his mouth.\n\nHe looked at her, his eyebrows knitting together in wonder. He grabbed the glass of water beside his plate and gulped the liquid, letting it push down the food that he has crushed. After wiping his water stained lips, he turned back to the athletic girl. She just sat in there, as if waiting for him to finish up his meal so she can take the utensils to the kitchen and wash them up. But still, Shinda knew that she was waiting for a chance\u2026 a chance to say something.\n\nShinda put down the spoon and fork, releasing the utensils from his grip. After another intake of water, he motioned to the other person in the room.\n\n\"Do you want to say something?\" He asked, waiting for a reply. The girl giggled, standing up and walking to him. She stopped behind him and leaned down, her lips brushing against the curve of his left ear.\n\n\"Listen here,\" she whispered. \"I know you like Ikusawa-senpai, and I heard that you're still obsessed with her.\" She added, her hot breath making the somewhat bashful guy shudder.\n\nShinda knew that this was the only chance that he has to take Ruriko. So, what he thought was right; the girl was there to make a deal with him.\n\n\"So, you want me to take Ruriko-san so you can have Shun Ukiya?\" Shinda cleared things out, his voice loud, yet hoping. Kaoru straightened her posture and walked in front of him leaning against the table. The glass tripped over, sending the water to flow on the table.\n\n\"That's not what I meant.\" Kaoru said, surprising Shinda, yet he doesn't look surprised at all. The water on the table dripped at the edge, making a tapping sound on the floor beneath the table.\n\n\"So, what do you mean?\" Shinda asked the girl, standing up and walking closer to her. The brown-haired girl pulled him by his collar and whispered to his ear. \"Tell her what you feel.\"\n\n\nShinda sat alone at the control room, thoughts flying through his mind. The unattended utensils are still on the table, the messy water reflecting the light from the setting sun.\n\nHe paused for a while, recalling what Kaoru had told her just that morning\u2026\n\n\n\"Tell her what you feel.\" Kaoru said, her sentence bringing silence to the room. After several minutes of silence, she continued. \"I know how it feels when you are not loved by the person that you love so much.\" She paused, her stare dropping to her feet. \"But still, I always tell my feelings to Ukiya-senpai, and now, I haven't given up on him yet. One day, he might love me, too, just like the way I love him. But\u2026 but\u2026 I already know that he\u2026 loves Ikusawa\u2026 senpai\u2026\" She paused again, her eyes sparkling. She felt soft male arms wrap around her back, and she leaned close to his chest.\n\n\"Okay then, maybe I shouldn't give up, too.\" Shinda said with a very comforting voice. He ran his hand through her short brown hair, and whispered, \"Thank you, Kaoru-chan.\"\n\nAnd so, the room remained in silence, with only the sound of the dripping water to echo through the room. The silence was never broken, not until the door swung open with a lad on the other side, his presence making Kaoru leave.\n\nEnd of Flashback\n\n/She loves him very much\u2026/ He thought to himself, remembering the scene where Kaoru tried not to let Shun see her in tears, tears that were caused by lad himself.\n\nShinda checked the water current, and afterwards, the map. After assuring that it would be just fine to leave the controls unattended, he walked to the room and left, heart thundering in his chest.\n\n\nA brown-haired girl stood by the deck, the wind playing with her long hair. The ribbon tied on her head played with the wind, too, dancing as the invisible force pulled it backwards. Totally drowned by her thoughts, she didn't hear the light footsteps that emerged from the control room nearby.\n\nThe setting sun cast shadows of the two figures that stood at the deck. He walked to her, running his hand through her hair and smelling the sweet scent of it. Surprised by the motion behind her, she turned back, sighing at the sight of her father's best friend's son. (A/N: Hey, what was that again? ^_^)\n\n\"Oh Shinda, what is it?\" Ruriko said between her sharp intakes of breath, holding her chest in surprise. The lad walked and set himself in a comfortable position beside her. He rested his crossed arms on the cold metal of the deck, staring far at the ocean.\n\n\"Ruriko-san,\" He began, eyes still fixed on a faraway distance. Even without a reply from the girl that he admires, he continued. \"I know that you already know this, but I love\u2026\" He paused, turning his head to face her. The girl dropped her glance on the ground, trying to avoid his gaze. He knew that she already know what he wanted to say. But yet, she tried to refrain him from saying it.\n\n\"Yes, yes, I know that you love poison gases very much. You even made a very strong poison last time in junior high when we had an experiment. I was totally shocked when-\" Ruriko's sentence was cut off by the lad's words.\n\n\"No, that's not what I meant.\" The white-haired lad said, staring at the girl with deep eyes. He saw the girl catch his glance, and obviously, she avoided it again. She smiled and tried another set of words.\n\n\"Oh, umm, yes, you love your knife that you made. You also used it in a school presentation back then and everyone was totally surprised with your exhibitions!\" Ruriko paused, looking at him in the eyes. Seeing that he was getting quite pissed off, she tried another sentence, hoping that he will leave her when he gets totally angry.\n\n\"Oh, maybe, I know you love this ship more than anything else. Right, you've been taking care of it for a very long time, and I know how much you love it. Don't worry, we would also take good care of it.\" Ruriko smiled at him, bravely trying to take a look. The lad looked pissed off, but yet, he kept his gaze on Ruriko. There was a tinge of desire on the way he looked at her, and, when he examined the girl's body with his deep red eyes, she realized that he was so firm to tell her what he felt for her.\n\n\"I love you, Ruriko-san.\" Shinda said, his gulp after his sentence audible to the girl in front of him. He stared at her bowed head hopingly, yet, with pain stinging his heart. He was sure that she loved Shun, but yet, he can't take it, and he doesn't want to.\n\n\"Shinda-san,\" Ruriko called out, raising her head slightly to meet his gaze. He waited calmly for her reply, trying to stop the tears, which threatened to flow from his ruby red eyes. A pain inside of him, a pain caused by Ruriko's rejection of him when they were in junior high, caused the tears. Now, he was probably questioning his mind.\n\n/Will she reject me again? /\n\n\"I'm sorry, Shinda-san.\" Ruriko said, her sorry bringing a pain deep inside Shinda's heart. And so, she continued. \"I know you know that I don't love you. I\u2026 I just treat you as a friend.\" She forced a comforting smile on her face, still trying to keep her eyes on her rubber shoes. \"Please understand.\" She ended, finally taking the urge to look up. Shinda's eyes were pooled up with tears, which were threatening to fall down any time during that moment. He stared at her lovingly, caringly\u2026 and with hatred and desire.\n\n\"I want you to be mine!\" Shinda shouted, pulling Ruriko by the girl's shoulders. He pulled her closer, causing his lips to brush against hers. She tried to pull herself away, screaming for help. Tears started to flow from her eyes as she felt his hot breath on the skin of her neck.\n\n\"Shinda-san, stop it! Help! Help!\" Finally after so much struggles, she heard heavy footsteps from somewhere nearby. Unable to take a look at her rescuers, she tried to push Shinda away. Opening her eyes, she saw a fist bury on the lad's face, sending his head to crash to the metal of the deck. The sound of Shinda's skull crashing to the metal made Ruriko scream much louder, and so did the blood that drip down from his head, staining his long white hair.\n\nShinda stood up, clenching his fist. He glared at his opponent, who was totally enraged by his lustful acts. Not wasting anymore second, he charged at Shun, attempting to deform his face with a punch. But, unfortunately, Shun blocked his attack, using his right arm to shield his face. Even with Ruriko's endless screaming for them to stop, Shun was totally determined to fight until one of them falls.\n\n\"You'll pay for trying to hurt my Rurippe!\" Shun shouted, burying a heavy fist on Shinda's face. The usually calm lad was unable to block his attack, since because he wasn't a good fighter. Lacking fighting skills, Shinda was still unable to block the next four punches. He swayed like a dummy used for practicing, with blood streaming down from his mouth. He tried to keep his balance, but, after Shun's final punch, he lost it. He leaned towards Ruriko and held her arms tightly, so that when he fell from the ship, she was with him.\n\nKaoru, who was the first person to notice that the two were already on their way to the cold ocean, grabbed a bundle of rope that was resting beside her feet. She immediately threw the end of the rope to the water, making it fly down side by side with Shun and Bancho who jumped to rescue the two.\n\nMegumi was snapped out of shock just in time. \"Wall of Shock Buffer!\" She demanded, and a wall appeared at the surface of the water, making Ruriko and Shinda's fall less hard as possible. And also, it gave them the time to reach the two before they are carried over farther or probably deeper in the strong waves.\n\nShun caught Ruriko's arm just before the green barrier disappeared. Catching a glimpse of the rope through the corner of his eye, he tried to grab the blurry object. After feeling the rough texture of the rope in his grip, he pulled himself upward, still hugging Ruriko closely.\n\n\"Are you all okay?\" A male voice from the ship asked. It was Kageyama, who was peeking from the deck with a flashlight. Things went by so fast that darkness was already spreading over everything.\n\n\"Rurippe's fine, and I am, too! Pull us up now!\" Shun shouted, trying not to let the cold water choke him. He heard a reply from Kageyama and moments later, they were being pulled up by Kaoru's strong hands. Shun shivered as the wind crash against his wet body. He hugged Ruriko tighter, and was shocked when a shark jumped from the water to bite his left foot. Fortunately, in his surprise, he pulled his foot up, causing the shark to bite nothing but air.\n\nRuriko stirred, half-unconscious because of what had happened. She could hear a lot of noise; Shun shouted about the sharks; Kageyama echoed his scream, warning Bancho who was unable to find where Shinda was. Ruriko half-opened her eyes, and, after seeing Shun's warm and comforting smile, she let herself drift into a deep slumber.\n\n\nRuriko's eyes popped open and she quickly sat up from bed, sweat rolling down from her temple. She looked beside her and saw everyone with smiles on their faces. Somehow, she could recall what had happened the day before. Right at that moment, 30 minutes have passed since midnight, indicating that the day before was over. And then, a question formed in her mind.\n\n\"How is Shinda-san doing?\" Ruriko asked. There was no reply. Everyone lost their smiles and bowed their heads with a sad frown. She felt her heart thundering in her chest. Could her guess be right?\n\n\"We were\u2026\" Shun began, his lower lip trembling. \"\u2026 unable to save him.\" He squeezed his eyes shut, causing small droplets of tears to drop from them. He knew that it was his fault, but yet, they tried to accuse Shinda himself, saying that he shouldn't have attempted to do 'that' to Ruriko.\n\nRuriko covered her mouth, breaking into sobs after several seconds of silence. They cried altogether for what seemed like eternity, until Ukkieya, Fei's monkey, suddenly jumped from his master's lap, running outside the door. Fei excused herself and quickly followed her pet monkey, afraid that the animal might break something.\n\nBack inside the room, the sorrow slowly, but surely left the group, who started to talk about what they think would happen on the next day. Shun caught the duty of controlling the ship in exchange for Shinda. He left for the control room, with Ruriko following him because she needed someone close to talk to.\n\nEven with a smile on her face, Kaoru can't forget the morning yesterday. She encouraged Shinda to tell Ruriko his feelings for her, so that she could get Shun for herself if Ruriko would accept Shinda. And so, the lad did what she told him too.\n\nSqueezing her eyes shut, she shook her head, trying to tell herself that it wasn't her fault.\n\n/Well, I didn't tell him to attempt to harass Ikusawa-senpai, did I? It's his fault all along\u2026/ She thought to herself, walking out of the room. Megane had just asked her why she was looking uncomfortable, but the girl didn't reply, as if she was never asked.\n\nFei lost sight of her monkey, and have checked almost every room available. She opened the door to the last room, which was the basement.\n\n\"Ukkieya! Ukkieya!\" She called out, knowing that if the monkey heard her, he'll surely come out. But that is if he wasn't hiding on purpose.\n\n\"Ukkieya! Come out now!\" She called out rather frightfully. She felt cold, somehow. She was about to run outside in front when he saw a monkey leaning against a large box. With a smile on her young face, she approached her quiet pet, thinking that the animal didn't notice that she was already there behind him.\n\nFei grabbed him with two bare hands and was surprised because the monkey didn't even tried to escape. She turned him over, and her eyes widened in horror. Her monkey was bloodstained, probably stabbed by a sharp object. Its eyes were wide open, showing no signs of life.\n\nFei trembled, but before she could let go of the dead body, she heard the sound of running water behind her. She quickly turned to her back and saw a giant wave, ready to crash her.\n\nTaking the opportunity to run, Fei didn't thought twice. She scampered on the floor, heading towards the basement door. Funny because she didn't even took any turns but she can see the door already. Anyway, she forgot all about it already, and also about the monkey, which she still held with her left hand. She reached out her right hand to reach for the open door's knob. The next thing was, the basement door shut tightly and the giant wave crashed against it.\n\n\nBancho was taking a stroll at the bottom floor of the ship. He heard the water crash, and was about to hurry on to the basement. But suddenly, an explosion echoed from the engine room. Thinking that the sound of the crashing water was just from outside the ship (since because he was at the bottom of the sea craft), he hurried on to the engine room, saying to himself that the engine might be damaged. He thought he could fix the problem, somehow, because he was familiar with machines and engines. Well, who wouldn't after working with the little genius Megane?\n\n\nAt the control room, Shun was busy, not just with taking care of the controls, but also with trying to cheer Ruriko up. He has been telling countless of corny jokes for hours, making Ruriko laugh. But, at that moment, joking around is over. Serenity crept over the place after Ruriko thanked Shun for all that he has done for her.\n\n\"It's nothing, really, Rurippe.\" Shun said half-comfortingly. He was then quieted down, knowing that it wasn't the time to tell some corny jokes. He knew that Ruriko needed someone to talk to; she need someone close to her, and that was him. He also felt that that time was the right moment to say what he felt for his childhood friend: Ruri the sniveler.\n\n\"Uh, Rurippe\u2026\" He called out, his face blushing furiously. /What's the matter with me? I'm just going to make a little confession! / He shouted in his thoughts, but quickly resumed back to reality when he saw Ruriko's hopeful eyes staring deeply into his'.\n\n\"Yes?\" Ruriko asked. She seemed to be trying to stop a smile, but her lips just kept curving upward. She waited hopefully for what he has to say. Somehow, she felt that he wouldn't joke anymore this time.\n\n\"Umm, you know, I think we're getting closer than before. You know, we used to have some quarrels back then, and then-\"\n\n\"And then?\" Ruriko quickly asked after Shun stopped for just a second. He scratched his head, trying to look for the right thing to say. Ruriko giggled at his childishness. He was way too different from the cool and manly Reiji Kageyama, but still, she liked him more than the popular lad.\n\n\"Okay, what I mean to say is\u2026\" Shun paused again, this time to let his cheeks blush redder than before. After taking a deep breathe, he finally said Ruriko's most awaited words from him. \"\u2026 I think I've fallen in love with you\u2026 err\u2026 yeah, I love you.\"\n\nRuriko was so much overjoyed. \"Really?\" she asked, eyes sparkling. She saw Shun nod slightly, and felt her cheeks redden. She edged closer to him and slowly closed her hazel eyes, waiting for his actions. Shun gulped; he knew what to do. He slowly bent down to kiss her, his eyes slowly closing. He waited for the finally meeting up of their lips in a kiss-\n\n-which never came.\n\nBoth of them were surprised when the door suddenly opened with a crash. A little figure stood by it, her shadow cast by the moon, which hung in the velvet sky behind her.\n\n\nReiko was looking for Fei for minutes, her search bringing her to the swimming pool. Seeing a time of relaxation, she stood by the pool and stared at the calm water. The liquid was shining because of the moonlight that it reflected, and it was as clear as a mirror that Reiko could see a perfect doppelganger of her in the water.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the childish girl smiled at her reflection, and of course, it smiled at the same time. Remembering her worry about her friend who was unseen for hours, Reiko turned to leave, her smile not leaving her face. She said goodbye to her reflection, and it did to her, too, although there is no voice from it.\n\nReiko decided to walk on, but before she could make a first step, she heard a giggle from behind her. As she turned around she caught a glimpse of a shadow in the pool, which went by quickly. Reiko thought that it might be just her imagination, so she decided to leave with a fast heartbeat. But suddenly, she stood frozen at the spot when she noticed something very odd.\n\nHer reflection in the pool was gone.\n\n\nRuriko stood up, trying to stop herself from blushing because of the romance that was just taking place before the door opened. She walked to the new person in the control room, knowing who it was.\n\n\"Fei-chan, is there something wrong?\" Ruriko asked, trying to see the younger girl's face, which was covered by darkness. She walked towards her, and when she was just inches away, the child suddenly fell on her, making her fall down. Ruriko sat herself up and looked down at the Chinese girl in her arms. She was pale\u2026 and cold.\n\n\"Fei-chan\u2026?\" Ruriko called out once again, fighting the thoughts in her mind. She shuddered when she felt something wet on her legs. Taking the urge, she took a peek. Blood was still streaming down from Ukkieya's body, staining Ruriko's smooth legs.\n\nRuriko screamed, kicking continuously until the two lifeless beings were away from her. She cried like a child as she hugged Shun tightly, almost crying her eyes out. After a split-second, almost everyone came rushing in one by one. Kaoru jumped inside the room, leaping over the dead bodies on the floor. Megumi, who was totally shocked and disgusted, covered her mouth and turned away, trying to stop herself from vomiting. The others tried to calm Ruriko down, and soon afterwards they decided to clean the mess up.\n\n\nReiko, after hearing Ruriko's scream, decided to run to the control room. But, before she could do so, a hand splashed out from the pool, grabbing her left foot and pulling her out of her balance. The hand was pale, and it was covered with wounds and seaweeds. She should have wondered where it came from, but she was too confused that all she can do is try to save herself. She managed to hold on to the tiles, which were arranged neatly around the pool. The girl screamed for help, still trying her best to hold on.\n\n\nKaoru quickly ran out of the control room, running at the speed of light. She heard Reiko's cries of help, fortunately, even if the pool was on the other side of the ship. Knowing that everyone will arrive shortly, she didn't hesitate to go on first, since because she felt that Reiko was in desperate need for help.\n\n/Don't worry, Asagiri-senpai, I'll be there! / Kaoru shouted in her thoughts. After a turn, she saw Reiko who was trying her best as to not to be pulled to the pool.\n\n\"Oh, Kaoru-chan desu! Help me desu!\" Reiko screamed with her usual childish voice and accent and with her usual 'desu'. (A/N: Hey, I shouldn't be joking around in a serious time like this. ^_^)\n\nKaoru ran with no response. Her eyes could only see Reiko's hand, which she raised for the athletic girl to hold on. Kaoru reached out her hand and caught Reiko's hand perfectly. But, maybe because of the tiles on which the older girl held on just moments before, her hand was wet. It slipped through Kaoru's grip, but still, the shorthaired girl held on to Reiko's ring finger, which was the only finger that she managed to grip still.\n\nThe current on the water pulled harder, causing Kaoru to crash down on the water. Before she fell with a splash, she felt a male hand grab her free hand, stopping her from being carried away. But unfortunately, Kaoru was unable to hold Reiko's ring finger any longer. It slipped from her strong grip.\n\nKaoru rose up to the surface of the water for air. She shivered when a breeze past by. The breeze felt cold because of the water, but Kaoru didn't care. She looked at the middle of the pool, and could only bite her lower lip when Reiko's dead body floated at the middle of the water. She was probably wounded deeply, because seconds later, fresh blood started to fill the pool.\n\nKaoru broke into bitter sobs, tears flowing freely from her eyes. She blamed herself from being unable to save the older girl. Kageyama, who was the one who managed to rescue Kaoru, can also feel the pain of losing another friend. He pulled Kaoru closer and felt the girl's hot tears on his wet chest. Nearby, he could also hear sobbing from the others, especially Ruriko, who didn't want to let go of Shun because of fear that she might die, too.\n\n\nAnother bang echoed from the engine room. Inside, Bancho was desperately pushing the door open. Some kind of poisonous gas was filling the air in the room, but he was unable to find where it came from.\n\nBancho squeezed his nose much harder, but still, the gas entered his body. His pushes are becoming weaker and weaker, until he weakly fell on his feeble knees. He looked at his hand; it was turning green already.\n\n/What kind of poison is this? / He asked himself. His hand dropped, and when he tried to move it, it wouldn't move. His whole body was paralyzed.\n\n\nThe GK party, after cleaning up the mess on the pool and grabbing some towels for Kaoru and Kageyama, headed back to the control room altogether, in fear that someone might die next. All of them were scared, even Shun and Kageyama.\n\nShun opened the door, and, he smiled when he saw Bancho seated in front of the controls. He walked to him, with Ruriko's arms wrapped around his left arm.\n\n\"Thanks, Bancho.\" Shun thanked the bigger but younger man, tapping his shoulders. His smile brought some comfort to his friends, somehow.\n\nAs Shun tapped the big guy's shoulder, the chair turned around. Bancho's eyes were lifeless, and his face was green. His saliva is bubbling down from his mouth, flowing together with his poisoned blood.\n\nShun leapt back, and Ruriko came into endless screaming again, falling on the floor. Megane rushed to her side to comfort the crying girl.\n\nTo everyone's surprise, Bancho was still alive. His feeble hand slowly raised; his fingers were pointing at the door.\n\nKaoru felt her heart pounding in her chest. She and Kageyama, who were wet because of the incident in the pool, didn't step in the control room in fear that the water might affect the controls.\n\nThe next thing she knew, Kaoru was pushed by Kageyama to lie on the ground. There was a silhouette outside the door, the lightning casting the figure's shadow. He raised his hand and threw something sharp at Bancho. Megumi screamed as she avoided the flying knife. The knife struck Bancho perfectly at the heart, sucking the remaining life out of him.\n\nRuriko screamed again, her screams being drowned by the loud tapping of raindrops on the cold metal ship. Kageyama quickly stood up and launched an attack.\n\n\"Shadow Edge!\" He commanded, and a black force exploded from the three black rings in front of him. But, the shadow easily avoided his attack, running outside. Without much thought, Kageyama followed him, getting soaked in the rain.\n\n/Where is he?! / Kageyama asked in his mind, throwing his glance in every direction to look for their intruder.\n\n\"Look out, de yansu!\" Megane shouted from the control room. He ran outside in panic, not minding the wet floor.\n\nKageyama quickly turned his head behind him. The only things that he saw were bloody red eyes, glaring at him with deep hatred. Before he could move, Kageyama felt cold rough arms surround him, and a second later, he and the shadow were falling from the ship, heads ready to crash to the cold and angry waves.\n\nMegane, who was the first person to rush outside next to Kageyama, ran to the deck and looked down on the water.\n\n\"They're being carried to the side of the ship, de yansu!\" He shouted, motioning to his friends. When he looked back at the water he was surprised when a figure suddenly jumped out, knocking him out of his feet. His glasses were thrown inches above his head. He stood up and tried to look for his glasses. With everyone busy on saving Kageyama, there was no one to help him.\n\nKaoru immediately jumped to the water without hesitating, taking a tight grip at the rope that Shun had thrown to her. She crashed to the water, forcing her eyes to keep open. She caught sight of the floating body of Kageyama, and immediately swam to him. With strong feminine arms, she carried him to the surface of the ocean for air.\n\nAbove the ship, Shun saw Kaoru waving her hand. He slowly pulled up the two from the water, and, after so much effort, the two were saved. Shun gasped for air, taking sharp intakes of breathe.\n\n\"He's wounded!\" Kaoru shouted, wrapping her handkerchief around a bleeding wound on Kageyama's arm. The boy stirred in unconsciousness, coughing every now and then. Kaoru carried him in her arms, but, because of fatigue, she wasn't able to rush him quickly to the room. She almost lost her balance as she stood up, but she knew that she was the only one who could carry him at that time.\n\nMegumi ran to Megane, after being snapped out from being shocked. She picked up his glasses from the ground and handed it to him.\n\n\"Here.\" She said, handing the spectacles to the little genius. He put on his glasses, thanking her in the process. The two of them stood up, but suddenly, a lightning struck from the sky, hitting Megane directly and sending bolts to his body.\n\nMegumi, in surprise, quickly leapt away from him. She covered her ears and screamed, trying her best not to hear Megane's cries for help. She was in fear that a lightning might strike her, too. She felt male arms carry her from the floor and carry her inside. It was Shun Ukiya, and running beside him was the tear-streaked Ruriko.\n\n\nMegumi was sitting in front of a bed, taking care of the unconscious Kageyama. Shun went to check the controls, together with Ruriko, because she doesn't want to let him go. Kaoru, after all the bandages were used up, went to get more bandages, since because the bleeding of Kageyama's wound won't stop. Actually, a shark almost bit his arm off, but fortunately, the creature's sharp fangs had just managed to cause a wound.\n\nThe radio stopped the music for news. Megumi listened half-consciously, trying her best to stay awake. And so, the reporter continued to speak alone.\n\n\"In a private ship at the middle of the sea, a lad was bitten by a shark. It was confirmed that he would die in ten seconds. And so, the countdown begins\u2026\"\n\nMegumi was snapped out of her nap. Wait, she was playing the soundtrack of Linkin Park, which was brought by Kageyama. How could there be a news?\n\nMegumi was in panic; she didn't know what to do. Kageyama was jerking roughly in his sleep, as if having a nightmare. Megumi stood frozen at the spot. She could hear the countdown\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\nKageyama suddenly dropped dead on the bed, without even the slightest signs of life. Megumi was about to cry, but she was surprised when the door suddenly opened. The figure that stood outside stepped in, and the door closed behind him. Megumi could hear the thunder roaring in the sky, but still, the sound from the radio was still audible. The song 'One Step Closer' started to play.\n\nThe figure stepped closer, and, due to the flash of light from the sky, Megumi was able to know who it was.\n\n\"Shinda Otoko\u2026\" She whispered rather sternly, taking a step backwards. Her body was shaking in fear, especially because she knew that the lad in front of him was already dead.\n\nHis mouth opened, and Megumi thought that there were fangs inside. But no, he wasn't going to bite her. He started to sing with the tape, and Megumi noticed something weird.\n\n\"Everything you say to me, takes me one step closer to my prey, and I'm about to kill!\" He sang, with a devilish smile on his face. Megumi felt hot tears as they stream down her face. She noticed something sparkling in Shinda's hand. Narrowing her eyes, she could see that it was sharp, and pointed. She have seen it just moments ago\u2026\n\nIt was the knife that was thrown at Bancho last time at the control room. She knew that it was it, because it almost hit her if she didn't dodge.\n\nBut, there was no help knowing. Shinda raised the knife and threw it skillfully on her. She screamed as the cold and sharp metal buried to her stomach. Blood dripped from her lips, and she was unable to keep herself up. She fell back on the wet floor; it was wet with salt water. Baby sharks started to make her their meal, but she can't feel their sharp fangs anymore. Slowly, she can't feel anything. She started to leave her life, slowly drifting away.\n\n\nKaoru banged her fists once again on the door.\n\n\"Megumi! Megumi! Open up!\" She shouted. She felt that something bad was happening inside, but she can't just leave. What if Megumi was still alive and she needed help?\n\nKaoru crashed her left foot on the door, and finally, it opened with a low shriek. Kaoru heard Shun and Ruriko's footsteps from nearby as she ran inside the huge room. She dashed at the end of the room where Kageyama's bed was and checked his pulse, but he was dead. She needn't check Megumi, who lied at the middle of the room, because, judging by all the blood in the floor, Kaoru was sure that the girl was dead.\n\n\"How are they?\" Shun shouted from outside. He tried to catch his breath, and was almost choked when he saw the two dead bodies, even with the darkness that was flooding the wide room. Eventually, Ruriko screamed and cried again. In her fear, she asked Kaoru to hurry on outside. Kaoru nodded and ran immediately. When she was halfway to the door, it suddenly closed, to the three's surprise. Kaoru felt her inside make a leap from its place, and her heart was thundering in her chest. At the door stood Shinda, clothes wet and covered with seaweeds. Blood was still dripping down from his head, and his eyes were bloody red. But yet, she could see the pain in it.\n\nShinda stepped forward. \"Kaoru-chan, it's so painful to be rejected.\" He said, taking another step. A tear rolled down from his left eye, and he wiped it eventually. Kaoru felt pity for him; she knew how hard it was to be rejected.\n\n\"But then, you showed me how to take the risk of being rejected, just to let her know my feelings.\" Shinda added, but this time, he didn't come any closer. He looked up at her, eyes pooled up with tears, \"Thank you\u2026\" he whispered before broking into sobs.\n\nKaoru felt hot tears roll down from her brown eyes. She thought that Shinda would despise her because she told him to tell Ruriko his feelings. But instead, he thanked her, and he took the positive side of Kaoru's plan for granted.\n\nKaoru walked to Shinda and hugged him. Eventually, he cried on her shoulder for what seemed like eternity, until there were no more tears left. He moved back and stared at her in the eyes.\n\n\"Kaoru-chan,\" He called out. Kaoru raised her eyebrow in reply, and he spoke up. \"I love you.\"\n\nKaoru was surprised that she quickly removed her arms from around his neck. Her heart started to beat faster, and she stepped back from him. \"No, Shinda, I\u2026\" She whispered, still taking continuous steps until she tripped over Megumi's lifeless figure.\n\nShinda walked to her, tears starting to flow from his eyes again. He knelt in front of her and swiftly pulled her for a kiss.\n\nKaoru's eyes widened. His lips were cold, and he felt so lifeless. Right, he was already dead.\n\nKaoru pushed him and moved back, goose bumps climbing through her spine. She was shaking in fear, especially when Shinda's face suddenly showed deep hatred. He glared down at her, with a desire for blood shining in his eyes. With angry hands, he pushed her to the wet floor, her body welcomed by baby sharks.\n\n\"I thought you would accept me! You're like her all along!\" Shinda shouted, turning his back on the girl and walking away.\n\nKaoru felt thousands of sharp fangs on all part of her body. It was so painful; they were starting to eat her up. Somehow, she felt that Megumi might be luckier than her, since because the baby sharks just bit her, not like what they are doing to her now. She screamed as she felt sharp fangs ripping of her skin. Others followed suit, slowly eating her life out of her.\n\n\nShun continued to bang his fists on the door, calling Kaoru's name continuously. He stopped, catching his breath.\n\n\"Ukiya-kun, I don't want to stay here anymore! Shinda is going to kill us all!\" Ruriko screamed, pulling Shun's arm continuously. She stopped when suddenly, the door opened. She covered her mouth at the sight of shreds of skin and muscles scattered on the floor. In the middle of the room next to Megumi was a skeleton, with only few muscles still attached to it.\n\nRuriko screamed, huge drop of tears falling from her eyes. She screamed again when suddenly, Shinda appeared from inside the room and grabbed Shun's neck. He raised the lad's feet from the ground, squeezing his neck in an attempt to kill him.\n\n\"Run away, Rurippe!\" Shun shouted forcefully, trying to put up a smile. He intently kicked Ruriko, urging her to run away. In her fear, Ruriko did as Shun told her. She scampered to her feet, heading for the deck.\n\nShun was unable to free himself, even with so much struggles. Life slowly drained out from his eyes, and, moments later, he fell dead on the floor.\n\n\nRuriko was confused on where to go. Her vision was turning blurry because of the rain, and because of her endless crying. She heard footsteps behind her, and she quickly turned around. She saw a blurry white color, and knowing who it was, she screamed again, her scream only to be engulfed by the deep and angry ocean. She covered her ears, and continued to scream like crazy while shaking her head.\n\n\"You rejected me\u2026\" She heard Shinda say. She opened her eyes and saw that he was walking closer and closer to her. She stepped back, her lips trembling and her body shaking. Everything was spinning, and all that she could hear was the loud pounding of her heart, and the footsteps, which are growing louder\u2026 and louder\u2026 and louder!\n\nThe next thing she knew, she has jumped from the deck heading fast to the waves. She committed suicide in fear of Shinda. She felt the cold water as she crashed against it, and it swallowed her rather welcomingly.\n\n\nShe blinked her eyes open, without difficulty even if she was under the water. Funny because she didn't drown, and now, she is breathing like normal, even under the ocean.\n\nRuriko removed the lock of brown hair that was covering her eyes, and was amazed by the sight in front of her. Beautiful mermaids swam past her; their tails were glistening with different colors.\n\nShe continued to stroll her eyes around, and as she turned around, she was surprised to see someone familiar; a lad with white hair and ruby red eyes.\n\nShinda Otoko.\n\nHe swam near her, and in her fear, she swam away.\n\n\nRuriko looked down at her feet, or probably tail. Her tail was golden yellow, and it was sparkling because of a light from somewhere.\n\nRuriko covered her mouth, and with her eyes pooled up with tears, she screamed.\n\n\n\nRuriko jolted up from bed. Her shirt was soaked with sweat, and a drop of perspiration rolled down from her temple. She glanced at the clock and the time said '1:24 am'.\n\nWiping the sweat from her forehead, she glanced beside her bed. Seated on the floor were Reiko and Fei, sleeping back to back and leaning on the side of Ruriko's bed. On a bed nearby was Megumi, silently staring at her with a book on her hand.\n\nThe door silently opened and Kaoru stepped in, trying to balance herself as she carried the bowl of hot water and placed it gently on the table beside Ruriko's bed. The athletic girl looked at Ruriko with a smile on her face.\n\n\"So, it's good that you're awake already. Seems like you're okay, I guess.\" Kaoru said rather cheerfully as she wrung the towel that she had just soaked in the hot water.\n\n\"What's the matter with you?\" Megumi asked from her bed, still staring at her brown-haired rival.\n\nRuriko paused for a while. So, is everything just a nightmare?\n\n\"Where are the others?\" Ruriko asked Kaoru worriedly. Kaoru giggled. She pulled a chair beside the bed and sat on it.\n\n\"Why do you look so nervous? Oh yeah, I know. It's because of what happened yesterday.\" Kaoru said, pushing Ruriko lightly on the shoulders to make her lie down again. Afterwards, she placed the wet towel on her senior's forehead.\n\n\"Well,\" Kaoru began, trying to make Ruriko feel much better. \"Megane and Bancho are in the control room. They should be taking control of the ship, or if they aren't doing that, they must be sleeping.\" Kaoru paused, and Ruriko giggled. Kaoru gave a smile and continued. \"Well, Shun and Shinda are settling things out, with Kageyama's help. Yeah, everyone is safe and sound, so don't worry too much.\" Kaoru managed a smile, but it faded away as she remembered her conversation with Shinda just before. Shinda forgave her, and even thanked her for her encouragement. She thought that he would despise her, though.\n\nRuriko noticed Kaoru's sudden silence. \"What's the matter, Kaoru-chan?\" She asked, concern showed by her face.\n\n\"No, it's nothing, really.\" Kaoru replied. \"So anyway, take a rest now. We'll be there tomorrow.\" She added, walking on to her bed. Before closing her eyes, she remembered something. \"And by the way, we found out that the water had some magical effects on girls. We'll explain it tomorrow.\"\n\nRuriko heard Megumi giggle. The girl kept her book and lied down on her bed, too, closing the light before completely shutting her eyes.\n\nRuriko sat up. /I need to say sorry to Shinda\u2026/ She thought to herself. It wasn't dark even with the light closed, but she didn't even noticed.\n\nRuriko tried to drop her right foot from the bed, but it won't move. She threw the blanket away and was astonished on what she saw. She doesn't have legs, but instead, she has a tail, a golden yellow tail.\n\n\n\nAuthor's Note (again): Umm, actually the word 'shinda' means 'dead' and the word 'otoko' means 'boy'. So, Shinda's name means dead boy. ^_^\n\nSorry if it's not too thrilling, and if there are some not-so-nice parts. Whew, it's good that it's over already. ^_^ Anyway, if you have some better suggestions for the title or the rating (again), just tell me. So anyway again, I guess this fic is my last update in this section before going back to school, except for if I could write another fic or chapter before June 17.\u00a0 So last one again, PLEASE REVIEW, I BEG YOU!!!"}

The Y applied for a $300,000 grant to cover the cost of the cogeneration (combined heat and power) system. Cogeneration systems use natural gas to produce energy and heat water.

Print This Item!\n\nFueling the Market\u2014Fragrance Observations\n\nBy: Amy Marks-McGee\n\npage 3 of 4\n\nSniffapalooza, founded by Karen Dubin and Karen Adams, often partners with fragrance houses such as Symrise and Firmenich to create intimate events for \u201cfragrance aficionados.\u201d These fragrance aficionados, non-industry individuals, get an inside look behind the scenes, and frequently get to preview new fragrance releases. In conjunction with Parisian retailer Printemps, Givaudan designed Perfume Workshops in April 2010, to \u201ceducate the wider public in the history and creation of fragrances.\u201d International Flavors and Fragrances (IFF) partnered with Parsons The New School for Design, The Museum of Modern Art and Coty Inc. to present HEADSPACE: A Symposium on Scent as Design on March 26, 2010 [covered in the June issue of GCI magazine\u2019s sister publication Perfumer & Flavorist and, in brief, in the July issue of GCI magazine]. The event was a one-day symposium on the conception, impact, and potential applications of scent.\n\nThe most significant fragrance collaboration to date is Longwood Garden\u2019s Making Scents: The Art and Passion of Fragrance exhibit, on view through Nov. 21, 2010. Several fragrance houses\u2014including Givaudan, IFF and Robertet\u2014and fragrance brands such as Chanel, Guerlain and Annick Goutal helped create this exhibit. Longwood Garden describes it as \u201cthe first major exhibition, an intersection of flora, fashion and science.\u201d To coincide with the event, Olivier Polge, an IFF perfumer, created the Always in Bloom fragrance.\n\nTechnology, Mobile Apps and YouTube\n\nMobile phone fragrance applications and the use of YouTube are the latest technologies being used for fine fragrance. In June 2010, Givaudan introduced the iPerfumer application for iPhone and Est\u00e9e Lauder launched its Ascent iPhone application. Both apps provide fragrance recommendations to help consumers sort through the crowded marketplace and make their shopping experience easier. In August 2010, Sephora announced SephoraMobile, its new mobile application. Similar to iPerfumer and Ascent iPhone, SephoraMobile will provide personalized recommendations and it will allow consumers access to their own beauty purchasing history.\n\nBesides fragrance advertisements and a handful of self proclaimed perfume critics, YouTube is relatively unused for information from fragrance suppliers. In April 2010, Arylessence, launched a YouTube channel ( to introduce its new rose collection. The company featured various interviews with perfumers and fragrance experts discussing these new rose fragrances. Katie Puckrik\u2014a broadcaster, journalist and performer\u2014pioneered the use of YouTube to give perfume reviews. In 2008, she launched Katie Puckrik Smells, and, as this issue goes to press, has 14,000 subscribers.\n\nIn July 2010, Kylie Minogue released her seventh fragrance, Pink Sparkle. To promote her fragrance prior to launch, Minogue posted the \u201cKylie Pink Sparkle Video Message,\u201d which had more than 22,000 views by September 1. It is only a matter of time before fragrance brands and suppliers better utilize YouTube and other social media sites to reach a wider, younger audience.\n\nCelebrity Figures"}

{"dataman_score": 4.0, "text": "\n\nKurt Ellis\nComments: 33\nArticle views: 1619\nLatest Badges:\n\nView all Kurt Ellis's badges.\n\nANC supporters. Raise your voice and be heard.\n\n17 February 2014, 12:00\n\nI feel I should make a disclaimer upfront, before I even get into the meat of this article. I am not a member of any political party and have no affinity to any of them. What I am is a South African. In fact, I feel that any person who swears an unwavering loyalty to any political party is an idiot. I apologise if this offends, as I cannot think of anything harsher to call them. Giving a political party your unwavering support is the equivalent to giving your spouse permission to abuse you and cheat on you, complaining about it when it happens, yet staying in a relationship with that person. You and your political party should have a symbiotic relationship. They should fulfil a need for you and in return, you should fulfil a need for them. Simple. But that is not the case in South Africa.\n\n\u00a0Men like Pixley Seme who co-founded the organisation and who studied at Columbia University and was awarded the Curtis Medal, Columbia\u2019s highest oratorical honour. He went on the study at Oxford University before becoming South Africa\u2019s first black lawyer. Men like John Dube who was an essayist, philosopher, educator, publisher, editor, novelist and a poet. Like Alfred Xuma, who was a member of Cornell University\u2019s Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity who boasted members like Dr Martin Luther King, Jesse Owens and Dick Gregory. And Sol Plaatjie who translated the works of Shakespeare into Tswana and who was fluent in seven languages. A linguist, a writer, a journalists and an intellectual. And then there is Oliver Tambo, Govan Mbeki, Walter Sisulu, Albert Luthuli and of course, Nelson Mandela. And there are many names that I have not listed who were all giants amongst mere South Africans. These men, my dear loyal ANC supporter, are the men you should be proud of. Men who sacrificed their lives for the betterment of an entire nation.\n\nSo my question is, how can you allow your organisation to go from Seme, Xuma, Tambo and Mandela \u2026 to Jacob Zuma? Is this what these men and other freedom fighters sacrificed their lives for? So a handful of black elite like President Zuma can spend R300 million on his own home, a spitting distance from people who have no running water, sewage or basic amenities. Nelson Mandela who passionately endorsed education once said \u201cEducation is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.\u201d You went from that, to Angie Motsepe\u2019s inability to deliver text books to scholars on time. To a six year old boy who falls and dies in a drop toilet at his school. Did these men and women die so that the North West Premier Thandi Modise can buy herself a new R1.3 Million car in the same week that Rinah Moilwa, a 59 year old woman died of heat exhaustion after she had to walk half a kilometre in the North West province to fetch clean water? Did they sacrifice everything for the Gupta\u2019s to have special privileges? For Shabir Schaik to play golf?\n\nAs I said initially, I am not affiliated to any political party. I am just a human being, and one of the blessings we have as human beings is the ability to tell right from wrong. Surely, what is happening to our country at the moment is not right. How can a person tasked with improving the lives of the people who voted him into the position build himself a R300 million home, when we have people going to bed hungry in shacks? That is not right.\n\nIf you, as an ANC supporter can personally go home and feel the ANC has met your needs \u2013 that the ANC is providing you and your family with quality education, quality services, quality healthcare, quality work and a better quality of life, then by all means, you should vote for them. But if they are not doing their part of the symbiotic relationship, then why should you do yours? Why should you vote to put people in mansions and fancy cars when you are living in squalor and struggling to make ends meet? Someone in this relationship is not meeting their end of the deal, and they need to get a wake up call. And not one like the service delivery protests, as they do not care. They are sitting in their mansions, watching the people burn on their flat screen TV\u2019s, drinking Johnnie Walker blue label and eating R50 000 worth of fast food. They do not care. The only time they will care is when you go to the polls, so you should make it count. If you are a real ANC supporter and have the best interest of the party at heart, then I say vote for someone else. Show the party you love that they are better than what they currently are. That you deserve more from then. Save the ANC, vote for some one else.\n\n\nRead News24\u2019s Comments Policy\n\n\nComment on this story\nAdd your comment\nComment 0 characters remaining\n\nRead more from our Users\n\nDiving into the South African gra...\n\nGovernment gets money and spends money in the same way an individual does. \u00a0Read more...\n\n1\u00a0comments 482\u00a0views\nSubmitted by\nDouw Snetler\nBlue Bulls rugby - Yawn!\n\nBeing an ardent Blue Bull supporter, it was with quite a bit of trepidation that I watched the semifinal last Saturday between the Bulls and Western Province.\u00a0Read more...\n\n1\u00a0comments 246\u00a0views\nSubmitted by\nThomas Freeman\nDo you ever question what you bel...\n\nAs the modern age marches on, it waits for nobody and sadly time has left many Christians behind, stuck in the Church age, but it has delightfully caused doubt in a growing number of Christians.\u00a0Read more...\n\n6\u00a0comments 126\u00a0views\nSubmitted by\nMinister Nene, I implore you...\n\nHaving listened to aspects of your MTBPS yesterday, and having read some of the analyses, it is clear that next year's budget speech proper is going to see a hike in personal taxes.\u00a0Read more...\n\n0\u00a0comments 60\u00a0views\nSubmitted by\nMy Wife Gave Me $10,000,000 For M...\n\nMy friends and loved ones 66 years ago today I came into this world.

{"dataman_score": 4.0, "text": "Just as Facebook swept the nation, so has the film about its creation, 'The Social Network.' Now the big question is, how much of the film is factual? We know it's based on true events and the primary characters are all real people, but is this really an accurate portrayal of the man behind it all, Mark Zuckerberg? The crowd at Stanford University's Startup School was certainly curious and Mark Zuckerberg himself has no problem addressing the issue.\n\nWhen the question first came up, Zuckerberg joked, \"Where do you want to start?\" He didn't seem particularly concerned about the misrepresented items, but did point out, \"The thing that I think is actually most thematically interesting that they got wrong is the whole framing of the movie.\" He added, \"They frame it as if the whole reason for making Facebook and building something was because I wanted to get girls.\" Funny thing is, Zuckerberg has been seeing the same girl since before he even created the site. More importantly, Zuckerberg took a jab at the movie industry, \"They just can't wrap their head around the idea that someone might build something because they like building things.\"\n\nAs for what the film got right, Zuckerberg got a laugh out of how accurately his wardrobe was represented. \"It's interesting what stuff they focused on getting right,\" Zuckerberg began. \"Every single shirt and fleece that I had in that movie is actually a shirt or fleece that I own.\"\n\nAll joking aside, the Facebook lawsuit may be over and done with, but thanks to 'The Social Network' and its popularity amongst critics and the public, the issue will likely still be debated for quite some time. The San Francisco Chronicle recently posted a piece about how back in 2004, Zuckerberg maliciously broke into the Winklesvosses' site, ConnectU, and exploited faulty code. There was even tons of skepticism when Zuckerberg first announced his plan to donate $100 million to the Newark school system. The Washington Post went as far to include Zuckerberg in a story about how billionaires are hurting public education with their massive donations.\n\nOn top of all the movie hype, Facebook is more of an integral part of a person's life than ever and is continuing to grow even stronger. Zuckerberg will likely be fielding 'The Social Network' accuracy questions for quite a while and will be praised and scrutinized in the spotlight for much longer and, considering the guy shows no signs of slowing down anytime soon, that'll probably be the case for most of his life. For now, take a look at Zuckerberg's appearance on Startup School below. The entire session is pretty interesting, but if you want to get straight to 'The Social Network' portion, skip ahead to the 5:18 mark.\n\nWatch live video from Startup School on Justin.tv"}

Construction is planned to begin in 2012 with the last project set to be completed in 2014.\n\nThe acquisitions form part of a strategic move by Canadian Solar to further cement its place in the US market. The company said in a statement that it expects that these projects will be the first of many, as it \u201cexpands from pure-play module sales in the United States to deeper collaboration with utility-scale project developers.\u201d\n\nThe projects were spearheaded by Canadian Solar's US projects team, which was initiated to further the company\u2019s project development presence in the US and complement its projects business in Canada. The Canadian business has already announced 340MW of projects in Ontario and has delivered engineering, procurement and construction services for three of those projects.\n\nShawn Qu, chief executive of Canadian Solar, said: \u201cThe investment we have made in starting the new US projects team signifies our continued commitment to the US market.

{"dataman_score": 4.0, "text": "Thursday, April 16, 2009\n\nWhy the LCWR is Being Investigated\n\nNote: This is a long post. Skip to the red Option 3 if you don't have time:\n\nIn his letter announcing a doctrinal review of the Leadership Conference for Women Religious, Cardinal William J. Levada makes reference to a 2001 meeting between LCWR officials and the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. At that meeting, the officials were invited to report on the reception by LCWR congregations of Church teaching on the sacramental priesthood, Dominus Iesus and \"the problem of homosexuality.\"\n\n\nOne address that has aroused particular concern and discussion was given at the LCWR 2007 annual assembly in Kansas City. The keynote that year was given by Sinsinawa Dominican Sister Laurie Brink and was titled \"A Marginal Life: Pursuing Holiness in the 21st Century\"(pdf). In her address, Sr. Laurie says that religious life stands at a moment of \"indecision\", being pushed and pulled toward numerous directions, and thus not moving.\n\nShe suggests religious are challenged toward:\n\u00b7 recognizing the various directions we as individuals and we as community are moving toward,\n\n\u00b7 evaluating which of these will foster our life and charism as women religious,and, finally,\n\n\u00b7 abandoning the other possibilities, sailing headlong into the direction we choose.\n\nSr. Laurie identifies four directions religious are being pushed or pulled and discusses the merits of each:\n1. Death with Dignity and Grace\n2. Acquiescence to Others\u2019 Expectations\n3. Sojourning in a New Land not yet Known\n4. Reconciliation for the Sake of the Mission\n\nRegarding the first, Sr. Laurie details the well-known signs of decline and says:\nFaced with this scenario some communities have made valiant choices to die with dignity and grace, to put their house in order, to pass on their charism and to ritualize that who they have been will not continue into the future. They do not invite or accept new candidates. They recognize that they have served the Church well, and now leave room for a new movement of the Spirit. They accept that their congregations were called into being for a specific purpose, and they endeavored enthusiastically to accomplish that purpose. Shoring up the crumbling walls of the institution would never be the desire of their founders. They acknowledge their accomplishments, engage in appropriate mourning and rejoicing, prepare for burial and recognize that others will come along after them.\n\n\"Death is the default mode for many congregations in denial\", she says, who are not actively \"ritualizing\" the death or making an appropriate burial which would recognize \"that the sisters have served long and well.\" Instead they place:\nan exorbitant focus on retirement and its financial needs, and a wholesale depression that manifests in apathy and individualism. These are the walking dead among us. And they don\u2019t even know it.\n\nRegarding 2 - \"Acquiescence to Others' Expectations,\" Sr. Laurie give a rather snide title and description to the phenomenon of new orders which are flourishing, but admits nonetheless their success:\nNot every congregation is giving up the ghost sort to speak. Some have attended to their reality and are making choices that a generation ago would have been anathema to their members. These groups are recognizing the changing atmosphere in the institutional Church, the reneging on the promises of Vatican II, and the seemingly conservative young adults interested in pursing a life of holiness through the profession of the evangelical counsels. They are taking seriously Pope John Paul II\u2019s call to pursue holiness first above all else. They are putting on the habit, or continuing to wear the habit with zest. They are renewing pious practices such as adoration and the Rosary. They are returning to the classroom.\n\nSome would critique that they are the nostalgic portrait of a time now passed. But they are flourishing. Young adults are finding in these communities a living image of their romantic view of Religious Life. They are entering. And they are staying.\n\nIn context, this option is clearly not recommended given the extremely condescending description of such congregations in the address. (You can read it beginning on page 13 of the pdf.)\n\nOption 3, \"Sojourning in a New Land not yet Known\", I suspect, is the one most relevant to the concerns raised by Cardinal Levada - not simply because it presents an option for the continuation of religious life, but because it purports to be descriptive of the reality in certain congregations. I'll post it here in its entirety and leave it to your own reflection. I may post on option 4 later, but gotta run:\nC. Sojourners in a New Land not yet Known\n\ni. Biblical Foundation: Hagar, the Mother of Another Great Nation (Gen\n\nThe story of Hagar, at first read, is a sad tale. An Egyptian handmaid to a powerful wife of a powerful resident alien is offered to the husband, in order to produce an heir. Misinterpreting these actions as the possibility of release and elevation in position, Hagar flaunts her new status before Sarah. Bad move. Abraham chooses wife over sexual slave, allowing Sarah to do with her property as she wishes. Sarah sorely mistreats Hagar, who eventually runs away. As the story is told from the perspective of Israel, God intervenes and commands that Hagar return to her abuser. A shred of hope is given her. God will bless her son, who will become a founder of another great nation. She returns dutifully at the word of a foreign God not her own.\n\nLater when Sarah spies Ishmael, the son of Hagar, playing with her son, Isaac, she again intercedes to Abraham. \"Drive out that slave and her son! No son of that slave is going to share the inheritance with my son Isaac!\" (Gen 21:9). Abraham is distressed\u2014not because of Hagar\u2014but because of his son. Again God promises this child, too, since he is an heir of Abraham, will be a great nation. Abraham sends the two off into the wilderness of Beersheva with only a skin of water and a bit of bread. When the water is gone, she places her son under a shrub and walks a distance away, for she cannot bear to watch him die. As luck would have it, God hears the child\u2019s cry (not the mother\u2019s?) and provides water in the desert. The text continues, \u201cGod was with the boy as he grew up\u201d (Gen 21:17). But the story never says that God was with Hagar.\n\nThe narrative of Hagar is also a tale of paradox. Hagar may be a member of the household, but she is a slave, an Egyptian slave at that. She is property for the woman in power, Sarah, to abuse and to dispose of. She is sexually exploited by the man of power, Abraham. The God of Israel is not her God, and sees little need to protect or care for her. But Hagar is, nonetheless, paralleled with Abraham. God promises Abraham that he will be the father of a great nation (Gen 12), a similar promise God also makes to Hagar (Gen 21:18). Abraham sends for a wife from among his kin for his son Isaac (Gen 24:4). Hagar will find a wife among her own Egyptians for her son, Ishmael (Gen 21:21). Sarah needed her man to fulfill her wishes, pleading with Abraham twice to take care of that upstart. But Hagar has no such man, and no such limitation. When last seen, Hagar is leading her son through the desert, bereft of God\u2019s guidance for her, with neither man nor family for support or protection. A seemingly vulnerable woman sojourning in an inhospitable land.\n\nii. Application\n\n\n\n\n\nLike Hagar wandering the wilderness with neither guide nor Israel\u2019s God, the congregations that choose the way of the sojourner may leave the land of religious familiarity, but they will also become a great nation, for women and men are hungering for their leadership, insights and inspiration."}

{"dataman_score": 4.0, "text": "Things To Remember In 2017\n\nMonday, January 09, 2017\n\nThings To  Remember in 2017  , lifestyle, life lessons, new year resolutions\n\nI kind of hoped that as soon as the 1st of January rolled around, I'd be carrying out my new year's resolutions. I'd be this new and improved version of myself, karating chopping my way through life. Don't ask me why 'karate chopping', I just see that as a sassy thing to do to get through hurdles. So I thought I'd be karate chopping through lack of motivation, anxiety - karate chop, doubt- karate chop, lack of creativity- karate chop. However, I soon realised that not only do I not work like this, but life doesn't work like this.\n\nThe 1st of January, does not bring a new you, and it takes time to work up to being able to karate chop your way through life. Something I had forgotten that was for sure. Last week, I spent most of my time feeling annoyed at myself for not being as motivated as i wanted to be. I struggled to get out of bed at a reasonable time, I struggled with motivation, and couldn't concentrate. My head was still in Christmas holiday mode.\n\nThis morning, I forced myself out of bed at a reasonable time and as I stood in the shower, I realised that 'hey it's okay to not always be on top form, and to give myself a bit of a break.' So I thought I'd write up some things that perhaps we need to remember in 2017, I guess these can be an update to my personal new year resolutions that I set to myself.\n\nDon't Be So Hard On Yourself:\n\nLast week, I was pretty horrible to myself,\u00a0making myself feel bad for not having any energy or motivation. Although I definitely think sometimes you need to give yourself a bit of a kick up the bum, it's also equally important to look after yourself. To listen to your body and perhaps get more sleep, or have a break. As they say, Rome wasn't built in a day, so you can't be expected to do all your new resolutions in the first week of January.\n\nStop Comparing Yourself:\n\nThis is possibly one of the most annoying things that people can say to you, it's one of those easier said than done things that are as helpful as someone saying 'why are you sad? Cheer up' or 'you really need to get over him/her/this situation' and you're like 'oh wow thanks Tracey, now I feel much better.' Just to clarify, no one called Tracey has ever said those things to me haha, but I felt like the name worked.\n\nBut we need to stop comparing ourselves, I am so bad at doing it, it's so easy to look on Instagram and compare your life to someone else's. Or your body. Or your blog. It's so easy to do and well we all do it. But now is the time to stop. I hate it when I let myself get down or in a mood cause I've been focusing on someone else. In 2017, I'm going to focus more on myself and what I'm doing. 2017 will be the year of me (without that making me sound like too much of a knob!) I will focus mainly on what I love, and what I'm doing rather than what anyone else is. I will try to stop trying to find inspiration from other people and find it within myself. I also need to step away from Instagram sometimes and remember\u00a0that yes it is a highlight reel.\n\nSay Yes To New Things:\n\nI am very much a home body, who doesn't like change or things outside of their comfort zone. However, I do in 2017 want to be a little more adventurous. Whether it's saying yes to going for a drink with a friend or going to London for an event. I feel like I need to push myself back out there again, as in 2016 I let my anxieties take over a lot.\n\nThink Positive:\n\nI'm a pretty positive person or so I like to think. I spent many of my teenage years being so negative and honestly it made me a very jealous and miserable person. As I've gotten older, I've tried to see the positive in even really shit situations, and it does help. I want to continue\u00a0this in 2017 and to remember what I have instead of perhaps envying someone else. I need to stop automatically thinking of the worst case scenario and perhaps thinking of the best, as I am notoriously bad at doing this!\n\nYou Can Do Anything You Put Your Mind To:\n\nI do have a lack of self confidence which in the past has stopped me from doing things. However, I want to work harder than I have worked before, and to not let doubt get in the way. You can self teach yourself anything these days, and I can do anything I put my mind to. It may take some hard work and determination but I can do it. Here's to not giving up!\n\nTo Stop Changing Myself:\n\nI've never been an overly self confident person with my looks, and being a blogger who lives life constantly on Instagram and Pinterest, you can sometimes feel like Quasi Modo compared to everyone else. I need to start believing in myself and believing that I am fine the way I am. To stop dreaming of nose jobs and lip fillers, and realising that everyone is different. Yes I may not look like a supermodel but that's okay. I need to remember that fairy lights and peonies are two of my favourite things, I find them both beautiful but they are both so different. That doesn't stop my admiration for the both of them though. We are all unique in our own way and that's what makes us.\n\n\u00a0I could probably go on for about three days with these kind of things, as you can tell I'm giving myself a big pep talk today! But I'm going to leave it there for now.\n\nWhat is one thing that you want to remember/improve on in 2017?\n\nYou Might Also Like"}
{"dataman_score": 4.0, "text": "Concerns raised about music/art option for middle school\n\nLITTLE ROCK \u2014 Art and music instructors in Arkansas say they are worried about the long-term consequences for students of a new law that makes those courses optional in middle school.\n\nThey argue that students will not receive as well-rounded an education, and that some school districts might opt to drop art or music to cut costs.\n\n\u201cAt the elementary level we plant the seeds and spend years nurturing and cultivating those loves, those beliefs, those practices,\u201d said Sharon Boyd-Struthers, an art teacher at Rockefeller Elementary and Early Childhood Magnet School in Little Rock. \u201cAnd then to give them a choice of one or the other at middle school absolutely takes away the possibility at the high school level.\u201d\n\nPaige Rose, president of the Arkansas Music Association, said there is also the fear that some school districts, struggling to make ends meet, might eliminate art or music altogether in seventh and eighth grade.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s just a matter of administrators are going to see it\u2019s a loophole there, a way to save money possibly \u2026 funnel other funds elsewhere if they can cut something, said Rose, an assistant professor of music education at the University of Central Arkansas.\n\n\u201cWhen they voted this through they probably didn\u2019t realize that language would do that,\u201d she said.\n\nPhyliss Stewart, spokeswoman for the Arkansas Department of Education, said last week she wasn\u2019t aware of any school administrators considering the elimination of either art or music to save costs.\n\n\u201cI would hope it would be based upon student interest, but the law doesn\u2019t require (school districts) to offer both,\u201d she said. \u201cIt says visual arts or performing arts.\u201d\n\nAct 599 of 2013 gives seventh- and eighth graders the option of taking either music or art, eliminating the long-standing requirement that they take one semester of each.\n\nThe legislation that became Act 599 was sponsored by Rep. Jim Nickels, D-Sherwood. Nickels did not return a call seeking comment Friday, but in presenting his bill on the House floor in March, he said he meant to give students a choice. He noted that because school regulations required seventh- and eighth-graders to take both a semester of art and a semester of music, students wanting to take band and choir were unable to do so.\n\n\u201cSo what we\u2019re trying to do is make it available for both seventh- and eighth-graders to have that choice,\u201d he said. \u201cThese classes are already there. This just gives the opportunity to the student, so I don\u2019t think it would be considered a mandate.\u201d\n\nPage said the Legislature\u2019s \u201cintentions were good,\u201d but she said the law also opens the door for potential problems in the future.\n\n\u201cThey wanted to allow students that are older in the intermediate grades a chance to explore the arts, whether it be music or visual arts, if they are starting to really identify with one of them,\u201d she said. \u201cSo, if art and music both have to happen you get a lot of kids, for instance, that are in band and will have to drop band for a semester to take visual arts for a semester. Of course, that\u2019s a big interruption in the sequence of teaching, so that\u2019s a problem.\u201d\n\nBut the downside that needs to be addressed, she said, \u201cis the negative implication that someone could easily say, \u2018well you only have to offer art or music, so we\u2019ll just cut a program,\u2019 \u201d adding that she recently received a call from a concerned parent who said the middle school\u2019s administrator was considering just that.\n\nPage declined to name the school to which the parent referred.\n\nShe and Boyd-Struthers both said that, originally, the bill would have allowed students in elementary school and middle school the choice, but that the bill was later amended to remove grades 1-6.\n\nShe said a coalition of instructors of fine arts from kindergarten through college is working to address questions raised about the possible negative consequences of Act 599. The Arkansas Arts Educators Consortium includes art, theater and music educators.\n\nThe ideal change, Page said, would be for both art and music to be mandated, but still allow students a choice.\n\n\u201cWe really are in support of the intentions\u201d of the law, she said. \u201cWe just want to try and protect those teachers and students that might be adversely affected by it if it is interpreted the wrong way.\u201d\n\nE.C. Walker, interim director of the Arkansas Education Association, said he did not know what kind of long-term impact the new law will have but that the AEA would prefer the Legislature \u201cnot go all the way down to mandating the curriculum and instruction like that.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat really is better served by letting the state board do that through regulations,\u201d Walker said.\n\nRichard Abernathy, executive director of the Arkansas Association of Educational Administrators, said his association has received inquiries from school administrators about offering just music or art.\n\n\u201cOur response is \u2018no,\u2019 Abernathy said. \u201cYou have to teach \u2026 both courses. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s even an option.\u201d\n\nStewart said she wasn\u2019t aware if any administrators had asked he state Department of Education about whether they can offer only music or art under Act 599.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure what the department would say,\u201d she said. \u201cI think they would say, \u2018well, you follow the law.\u2019\u201d"}

Burnett was awful, but his outing wasn't fantasy's all-time worst\n\nGiants' Pablo Sandoval the latest in string of injured 3Bs\n\nBy Steve Gardner, USA TODAY\n\nWhat is it with third basemen and in-season injuries? First Ryan Zimmerman hit the disabled list, then Evan Longoria and Kevin Youkilis and now ...\n\nThe Giants' Pablo Sandoval has been diagnosed with a broken hamate bone in his left hand, an injury he suffered in last Wednesday's game against the Marlins. The ailment is similar to the one that sidelined him for six weeks last season, although that one was his to right hand.\n\nSandoval was off to an excellent start, hitting .315 with five homers, 15 RBI and a .912 OPS. He had tried to play through the pain the past few days before it became too much last night and he had to leave the game against the Miami Marlins. He had started every one of the Giants' 24 games at third base.\n\nWhile the Giants may find a way to win without Kung Fu Panda (and they did go 25-16 in those 41 games he missed last year), fantasy owners may find the task a bit more difficult.\n\nTo fill his spot on the roster, the Giants have called up Conor Gillaspie from Class AAA Fresno, where he was hitting .362 with three homers and 13 RBI in 94 at-bats. Gillaspie appeared in 15 games last year for San Francisco and hit .263 with a homer and two RBI.\n\nGillaspie figures to get most of the playing time at third \u2013 and is worth picking up in NL-only leagues for that reason. However, the Giants also could use Manny Burriss, Ryan Theriot or even Brett Pill there.\n\nPill has the most offensive potential of the group, but he never has played third base in the majors and has only six games' worth of experience there in the minors. However, he did play second base (57 games) for the first time in his pro career last season at Fresno, so perhaps the Giants will give him a look at the hot corner.\n\nEarlier in the week, I went through some possible fantasy replacements at third base for Longoria \u2013 including Chris Davis, Chipper Jones, Pedro Alvarez, Kyle Seager, Ty Wigginton, Wilson Betemit and Maicer Izturis.\n\nThere may still be a chance that the Astros' Chris Johnson is also available as a Sandoval replacement. He's currently owned in just 18% of CBS Sports leagues, but probably not for long after hitting two homers and driving in six runs yesterday against the Mets.\n\nWith the addition of Youkilis and Sandoval to the DL in the past two days, that pool has likely shrunk considerably to the point where callups such as Gillaspie and Boston's Will Middlebrooks may end up being the only options in deeper leagues.\n\nCan Johnny Damon succeed in Cleveland?"}

I took my Bigma and k-x, but found that when photographing lemurs in the forests, most of the time the distances were not great, but the light levels were poor, so the 70-200 2.8 would have been a better choice. However, there were some occasions, particularily for birds, where the longer focal length was useful, and the light was ok.\n\nThe sigma 70-200 plus teleconverter combination is lighter than the bigma, which would have also been an advantage as the terrain was often difficult and most shots were hand-held. So I gather that what I need is an old sigma 70-200 (I assume series 1 rather than 2) and a sigma 2x. Any other combinations that anyone has used successfully?\n\n\u00a0BrianA2's gear list:BrianA2's gear list\nMinolta DiMAGE 7 Minolta DiMAGE A1 Konica Minolta DiMAGE A2 Canon EOS 40D Pentax K-r +10 more\nKeyboard shortcuts:\nFForum PPrevious NNext WNext unread UUpvote SSubscribe RReply QQuote BBookmark MMy threads\nColor scheme?

The headlines today however indicated a sense of optimism about the possibility of an upcoming Apple TV. This sentiment could support the stock for a while and shorting is off the table unless I see relative weakness in the stock. Still, AAPL stays on my watch list for a potential trade to the downside; I'm not pulling the trigger yet.\n\nMonday, October 17, 2011\n\nHow to find the next Green Mountain?\n\nGreen Mountain Coffee sold off hard today after David Einhorn presented his short thesis.

Prices hit the target at the lower channel boundary and reversed on the intraday chart. Since markets are deeply oversold and momentum seemed to weaken, I didn't consider scaling out of the position. Moving forward, I keep FDX on my watchlist to re-enter on the short side . Let's see how price will behave around $71.\n\nTuesday, October 4, 2011\n\nDoug Kass Calling a Bottom Again\n\nFrequent readers of this blog know what I'm thinking about market pundit Doug Kass, a frequent CNBC guest who does not publish his investment track record. It was therefore difficult for me to understand how investors can even listen to him and other Fast & Mad Money talking heads (I understand now after reading more on the topic of crowd psychology).\n\nAnyways, Kass has been calling a bottom again (\"I believe that the lows of the year are in\", Sep 26 2011). As discussed in other posts (March 23, 2010; Feb 7, 2011) , there is no statistical evidence that Kass' calls differ from random calls. In fact, we'll never forget his legendary call to buy Financials on Jan 14 2008.\nKass compares the current situation with the mood of the markets in February 2009.\n\nHere is my comparison: one of the indicators I'm looking at is the number of new 52-week highs lows. In 2009, there was a clear divergence between price and the number of new high/lows: the the sell-off was loosing steam. The situation is entirely different now: there hasn't been any divergence in the last months. Also note that the number of new lows is not at extremes levels, compared to 2008/09. Based on this indicator, stocks have more room to fall in my opinion:\u00a0\n\nThe only positive is that indices are approaching major support levels, but this itself does not mean we'll see a bottom. (It's like driving on a highway: the fact that there is an exit coming up doesn't mean I will take it. Only when I start using my blinker, you can infer that I might be willing to leave the highway.)"}

{"dataman_score": 4.0, "text": "Frenzy in storage market as data growth casts shadow\n\nMicroscope contributor\n\n\n\nWhat made it so frenetic was a sudden surge of activity in flash storage as well but the terrible twins of storage so far this year have been files and clouds. Everyone has been kissing cloud computing and promising to get the rampaging file elephant herd under control.\n\n\nThe scene was set recently by IDC coming out with version 2 of its EMC-sponsored data explosion white paper. We now have digital shadows and the world\u2019s digital data total is approaching several squillion whateverbytes, enough to send EMC marketing flacks into dances of information management glee.\n\n\nThere are two approaches to the file deluge: sidestep it by having files in the cloud; or confront it with clustered de-duplicated file stores. IBM bought XIV for its grid or clustered file storage technology. EMC bought PI and put its boss Paul Maritz in charge of its cloud computing activities. Brocade launched its massive datacentre switch and added file management to the switch. Brocade, HDS and BluArc agreed to take each other\u2019s super filer box, file management software and file virtualisation software.\n\n\nBrocade is rapidly strengthening its file area network products and has possibly the most rounded networked file management product set of any vendor. Other pieces of the file puzzle include eDiscovery and content management with EMC\u2019s document sciences acquisition bedding in nicely with documentum and Autonomy zooming up the awareness charts with its Zantaz eDiscovery and legal hold software.\n\n\nThere is also archiving with every supplier in the field and their brother putting out updated file and email archiving products. The Holy Grail of a single unified mega-archive covering files, emails, compliance and legal discovery concerns looks to be a mirage though. It just will not happen.\n\n\nBesides this frantic activity, disk arrays looked mundane with regular but predictable array upgrades, until EMC lobbed its flash grenade and added solid state drives to Symmetrix.\n\n\nApple launched its MacBook Air with flash option and suddenly flash substitution for hard drives was on everyone\u2019s hot topic list. It is not going to happen except for absolutely-must-have-performance customers until 2010 or so but happen it will. The technology is starting to look that solid.\n\n\nConsumer storage matters are driving suppliers with Seagate and Western Digital focusing more and more on this sector. EMC mounted a surprise acquisition raid on Iomega for its consumer and Soho/SMB removable disk Rev technology and China market connections. Drobo introduced its lovely back-up box and cloud back-up services for consumers and SMBs multiplied.\n\n\nGreen stopped being exciting and retreated into the taken-for-granted background. Tape didn\u2019t get as much of a boost as vendors might wish from tape being the greenest storage of all. Tandberg Data nearly crashed and burned, losing tons of money but stopped on the brink from which state it may recover. PivotStor introduced three relatively standard tape automation products but appears to have such a solid grasp of channel fundamentals that it may well profit as other tape vendors are still trying to build great business models involving disk and tape combinations.\n\n\nThe big galactic force exerting its huge gravitational pull on storage was VMware. Every storage vendor rushed to put a VMare-friendly face on their products, some even encapsulating their products as VMware virtual machines and you can\u2019t get any deeper into VMware\u2019s bed than that but remember, VMware doesn\u2019t do monogamy. And neither should you. Hyper-V is coming.\n\n\nDe-duplication spread and spread but vendors found that one de-dupe size does not fit all. The technology is absolutely necessary to deal with rampant file bloat but storage system vendors feel the need to differentiate their technology, not wanting to be FalconStor clones. So much so that IBM is now reported to be trying to buy Diligent.\n\n\nWhether you store files in your datacentre or in the cloud there is absolutely no point in duplicated information. When you\u2019re storing petabytes, even exabytes of files, then de-duping can cut your costs like nothing else.\n\n\nFlash is nice and promises faster access to data but the big, big need is capacity. Just as well as Seagate is revealing its HAMR and bit pattern media plans with 45TB 3.5-inch drives possible in a few years time. Without that and de-dupe we could all drown under a file flood.\n\n\n\nChris Mellor is editor at\n\nJoin the conversation Comment\n\n\n\n    Contribute to the conversation\n"}

{"dataman_score": 4.0, "text": "Ways to keep warm this winter\n\nHave you noticed a chill in the morning air? The fact that it\u2019s still dark when you leave for gym? Or roll over to switch your alarm to \u2018snooze\u2019? Winter is just around the corner!\n\nIf you\u2019re one of those people that freeze when the temperature drops, it\u2019s time to pull on your comfy slippers and take note of the following tips for keeping warm this winter\u2026\n\nImage by \u00a9Imagerymajestic on Freedigitalphotos.net\n\n1 / Layers are a must! When it comes to dressing for the cold, it\u2019s best to wear a number of thin layers, rather than one thick layer. Choose wool, cotton, or fleece materials, and items such as vests and long-sleeved tops that will trap warm air close to your body.\n\nDid you know that you lose most of your heat from your head? Top off your layered look with a scarf and hat or beanie to make sure you stay toasty if you venture out of doors. The bonus? Layers mean you\u2019ll look trendy and be warm at the same time!\n\nKeep the heat in\n\n2 / Shut the door! The temperature drops dramatically when the sun goes down. Keep windows and internal doors closed at night to trap the day\u2019s heat indoors. Make sure to close your external windows and curtains before the sun goes down to stop heat escaping and to keep out nasty winter draughts. This will ensure that the day\u2019s heat stays inside \u2013 where you need it most.\n\n3 / Let in the sun! While it\u2019s important to close up at night, try to let in as much sun as possible during the day. This will warm up your inside environment while also making it seem more cheerful. Houses can often be cold and damp \u2013 open the windows if the temperature outside is warmer than the temperature inside and remove any obstacles to the sun warming the house (think large pot plants in front of windows or trellises leaning against the exterior walls).\n\n4 / Feast! Your body keeps warm using the food you\u2019ve eaten and we all know that winter\u2019s the perfect time for comfort food. But, don\u2019t just gobble everything in sight \u2013 you\u2019ll regret it at some point! Help your body cope and fight off infection by eating regular, hot, home-cooked meals that contain carbs such as pasta or rice. Or you can whip a hearty vegetable soup or stew. A warm oven means a delicious meal and a toasty kitchen\u2026\n\nTop tips for winter warmth\n\nImage by \u00a9ifood.tv\n\n5 /Snuggle up!The air\u2019s colder at ground level so if you\u2019re sitting still for long periods of time, lift your feet up, and keep them covered with socks or slippers. It also helps to cover up with a blanket or shawl for extra warmth. Have concrete floors? Use rugs or carpets to prevent heat loss through the floor and to give you a nice, warm surface to walk on. Consider using a heater to keep your work zone comfy \u2013 just make sure you never leave it unattended.\n\n6 / Get moving! Exercise may seem like the last thing you want to do when it\u2019s cold and dark outside but it\u2019s one of the smartest moves you can make to\u00a0stay warm in winter. Exercise gets the blood pumping around your body, causing it to warm up, and increases blood flow to the skin, making it warmer. A warm body means better blood circulation which in turn means you will be more tolerant of the cold. Also, the rush of endorphins brought on by exercise will boost your energy and mood, making it easier to cope with the dark days ahead!\n\n7 / Stay connected! Studies have proven that people feel colder when isolated. Rather than sitting home alone because you can\u2019t bear to brave the cold, see friends and family, and have fun. The greater your level of interaction, the warmer you\u2019ll feel \u2013 inside and out. Cuddle up with your loved one and generate some extra body heat or play board games in front of the fire with friends \u2013 you don\u2019t have to leave the house; just make sure you see some friendly faces. Again, socialising is an activity that generates warmth and lifts your spirits.\n\nImage by \u00a9stockimages on Freedigitalphotos.net\n\n8 / Sleep tight!

From appropriate chemical storage to safety showers and beyond, we can help you take the necessary precautions to ensure that your students are properly protected.\n\nWhen students see that a laboratory is properly equipped, they will come to understand the paramount importance of lab safety rules. The right protection will help students and teachers feel more secure as they conduct educational experiments. Contact Hertz Furniture to find out how you can furnish your laboratory with the appropriate lab safety equipment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRefine Your Results\n  \u2022 Refined By\n  \u2022 Price\n    \u2022 $1250 - $1499.99\n    \u2022 $1500 - $1999.99\n    \u2022 $8000 - $9999.99\n  \u2022 Accessories\n    \u2022 View all Accessories\n  \u2022 Folding\n    \u2022 Non-Folding\n  \u2022 Warranty\n    \u2022 Limited Lifetime\n  \u2022 Promotion\n    \u2022 On Special Now\n  \u2022 Length\n    \u2022 32\n    \u2022 36\n    \u2022 48\nShow All Refines\u2026\nYour Results (1\u20135 of 5)\nPage of 1\nEncourage budding young scientists to conduct experiments with lab furniture from Diversified Woodcrafts. When productivity depends on appropriate science furniture, Diversified Woodcrafts has the models you need to promote success. The right lab tables, lab sinks and microscope tables will put young chemists and biologists on the path toward success.\n\nScience lab furniture requires extra durability. When students are working with tough materials, you need to ensure that an accidental spill won't ruin your lab tables or workstations. With specially-designed products from Diversified Wood Crafts, students can enjoy the full range of educational experiments without fear of damage to equipment.\n\nTo start with, students need an appropriate work surface in order to take notes, record data, and arrange experiments. Lab tables are specially designed to be functional during both frontal instruction and experiments. Diversified Woodcrafts offers three different kinds of tabletops, so you can choose the material that will support mediums your students will be working with. From basic High-Pressure Laminate to more durable ChemGuard, and finally ultra-tough Solid Epoxy Resin, you can find the ideal material for your work environment.\n\nIn addition to the work surface material of your science lab tables, you also need to choose the ideal configuration. While the two-student lab table provides maximum flexibility in terms of arrangement, lab workstations are another viable option. Workstations come in both two- and four-student models so you can maximize classroom space and enable students to work in larger groups. However, if your science classroom hosts a lot of frontal lessons, forward-facing workstations are ideal because no teacher wants to speak to students' backs.\n\nLab stations also have the additional benefit of a built-in lab sink. With water and gas fixtures readily-available to each small group of students, it is easier to conduct experiments independently and efficiently. Ultimately, the right choice between laboratory tables and lab workstations will depend on what they are being used for and what a school's science furniture budget is.\n\nFor those who opt out of the workstation option, it is still necessary to furnish the experiment space with lab sinks. Rather than having them as part of student workspaces, you can simply install a few laboratory sinks around the science classroom. Like work surfaces, lab sinks should be extra durable so they won't get damaged by chemicals and other harsh substances.\n\nIf your school doesn't have a designated science lab, or your instructors want a way to transport experiments without lifting sensitive materials, mobile labs can really come in handy. These freestanding units roll into position on large casters and can be locked into place for secure standing. With mobile labs any study space can be instantly transformed into a functional hands-on science classroom.\n\nIn addition to the basic must-haves, you might want to consider some extra science lab furniture from Diversified Woodcrafts. It is always good to have some storage space in the lab so you can keep microscopes, pipettes, petri dishes and other experiment materials close at hand. We have wall-mounted and freestanding cabinets with either opaque or glass doors. There are also special microscope storage cabinets which protect your valuable equipment.\n\nHertz Furniture brings you top of the line science furniture from Diversified Woodcrafts. This functional lab furniture comes with a complimentary Limited Lifetime Warranty which guarantees you many years of worry-free use. Figuring out the ideal arrangement for a science lab can be quite complicated, that's why the Hertz Design Center is here to help you with free design and project-planning advice. With excellent science furniture, you can start to inspire the doctors, engineers and scientists of tomorrow."}

(Gary Coronado/The Palm Beach Post)\n\n\nTri-Rail Coastal photo\nTri-Rail Coastal\n\nBy Willie Howard\n\nPalm Beach Post Staff Writer\n\nPalm Beach County Commissioner Steven Abrams rides Tri-Rail to his office in West Palm Beach from his home in Boca Raton.\n\nAfter the 41-minute ride, Abrams steps off the train at the Tri-Rail station on Tamarind Avenue, taps his prepaid card on a card reader to log the trip and begins the 12-minute walk east toward his office in the county Governmental Center.\n\nAbrams, who is chairman of the South Florida Regional Transportation Authority, the agency that operates Tri-Rail, grew up riding buses in Philadelphia and is something of a cheerleader for public transportation in South Florida.\n\nAbrams says he saves up to $100 a week and has lost about 10 pounds since he started riding Tri-Rail to work 18 months ago. He also reads, responds to emails and talks with constituents, things he couldn\u2019t do in his car.\n\n\u201cI watch the traffic jams on I-95 from the train,\u201d Abrams said.\n\nAbrams is optimistic about plans for an eastern companion to Tri-Rail \u2014 Tri-Rail Coastal \u2014 that would take passengers into the hearts of coastal cities from Jupiter to Miami.\n\nTri-Rail runs west of many downtowns along the CSX tracks. The proposed Tri-Rail Coastal train would run farther east on the Florida East Coast Railway tracks \u2014 the same rail line that Henry Flagler built to settle Florida\u2019s east coast that today runs close to U.S. 1 in much of the county.\n\nPlans call for connections that would link existing Tri-Rail service to the slower, multi-stop Tri-Rail Coastal system. Passengers could travel longer distances on Tri-Rail, then transfer to the short-hop coastal train to reach their final destinations.\n\n\nTransportation planners say the system would offer coastal passengers faster, less-expensive transportation that would make commuters more productive because they could read and conduct business on the trains instead of driving.\n\nTraffic congestion cost drivers in Palm Beach, Broward and Miami-Dade counties $2.9 billion, or $785 per commuter, and 38 hours of time during 2010, according to the Texas Transportation Institute, a transportation research agency based at Texas A&M University.\n\n\u201cGiving folks the ability to have a solid north-south spine that connects to Tri-Rail is what is needed in that corridor,\u201d said Amie Goddeau, manager of the Florida East Coast Corridor Study for the Florida Department of Transportation.\n\nThe intercity rail plan is one of two passenger rail proposals for the FEC tracks.\n\nProponents of the coastal city rail service are more hopeful that it will become a reality now that Florida East Coast Industries, a Coral Gables-based railroad and real estate company, is rolling out its $1 billion All Aboard Florida plan to whisk passengers from Miami to Orlando with stops in Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach.\n\n\u201cCommuter rail is the next logical step now that we\u2019re moving forward with the All Aboard Florida project,\u201d said Husein Cumber, a vice president with Florida East Coast Industries. \u201cWe\u2019re very supportive of the commuter rail in the FEC corridor.\u201d\n\nFlorida East Coast Industries recently bought the Sewell Hardware warehouse on Evernia Street west of Quadrille Boulevard in West Palm Beach for an All Aboard Florida station.\n\n\nExpected to begin offering service by early 2015, All Aboard Florida would be the first passenger service on the FEC tracks since 1968. Double tracks being built for All Aboard Florida are expected to help launch the short-hop coastal rail service, which in turn would give passengers a way to reach stations where they could catch the Miami-to-Orlando trains.\n\n\u201cAll Aboard Florida service will create a visible, tangible passenger rail service that will increase demand for more rail,\u201d said Kim DeLaney, strategic development coordinator for the Treasure Coast Regional Planning Council.\n\nCities along the FEC tracks are expected to benefit from the intercity rail service in several ways, including development near the stations, reductions in traffic congestion and possibly new residents. Many cities support the system, at least in concept.\n\nWilliam Waters, director of community sustainability for Lake Worth, said the added mobility could encourage people to move into walkable cities such as Lake Worth.\n\n\u201cYou could live in Lake Worth and work in Fort Lauderdale,\u201d he said. \u201cYou could hop on a train and be at work quickly.\u201d\n\nJupiter Town Manager Andy Lukasik said passenger rail service could reduce traffic congestion in the town. The availability of a passenger train, he said, would be an incentive for companies to move into coastal cities such as Jupiter.\n\nIn Boynton Beach, a passenger rail station between Boynton Beach Boulevard and Ocean Avenue would be \u201cthe transforming moment\u201d for the city\u2019s downtown, Interim City Manager Lori LaVerriere said.\n\nBoca Raton Mayor Susan Whelchel said the intercity rail service would be a \u201cvery, very strong economic engine\u201d for Boca Raton, which is planning a station on the FEC tracks south of Palmetto Park Road.\n\n\u201cWe look forward to its ability to promote our downtown,\u201d Whelchel said.\n\nThe Palm Beach Gardens City Council passed a resolution in 2010 in support of passenger rail service on the FEC tracks, citing improved mobility for residents, reductions in fuel consumption and the possibility of new jobs through economic development.\n\nThe Fast Start plan for a coastal passenger rail service on the FEC tracks is gaining steam, but organizers still have several hurdles to overcome before passengers will be able to ride a train from Jupiter to Fort Lauderdale or from Lake Worth to Palm Beach Gardens.\n\nNo money is available to do engineering work, buy land or build the stations \u2014 an estimated capital investment of $300 million. Planners say grant money is likely to cover much of the initial cost.\n\n\nThe bigger hurdle is the estimated $15 million to $20 million in annual operating cost of the coastal passenger rail system, said Joseph Quinty, transportation planning manager for the SFRTA.\n\nOperating money, planners say, should come from the cities that benefit from passenger trains.\n\nPassenger fares are expected to cover about a fifth of the operating cost of the coastal city rail system. The other 80 percent would have to be made up somewhere. But with city budgets hammered by the housing bust, planners are searching for creative ways to subsidize the coastal rail service\u2019s operations.\n\nThe SFRTA and other agencies involved in planning the Tri-Rail Coastal system are developing economic studies showing how coastal cities would benefit from passenger stations on the FEC tracks. Planners are scheduled to begin meetings with city officials this month.\n\nFinancing methods being considered include zones near the stations that would function like small community redevelopment agencies. The portion of property taxes generated by the increase in property values near the stations would be used to support the operation of the rail system. Advertising sales at the stations also could generate revenue.\n\nOne key question: Will South Florida drivers be willing to park their cars to ride trains?\n\nTri-Rail ridership dropped to 3.6 million during the 2009-10 budget year, but grew last year to just over 4 million riders during the year that ended June 30.\n\n\nPeople who live within walking distance of a station would be more likely to use the intercity trains than Tri-Rail, which often requires driving to a station and parking, said Ruth Steiner, an associate professor of urban and regional planning at the University of Florida.\n\n\u201cOnce they get into their car, they are likely to continue on their journey because the time they spend waiting for the train is lost time,\u201d Steiner said. \u201cThe FEC train can eliminate the need to ever get into a car.\u201d\n\nAbrams believes Tri-Rail Coastal service will become a reality.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s only a matter of time before all the issues can be resolved,\u201d Abrams said. \u201cIt\u2019s an affordable way to get people to work and school, which is good for our economy.\u201d\n\nOthers are more skeptical.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if we\u2019ll be around long enough to actually see it,\u201d Lantana Mayor David Stewart said. \u201cYou plan for it, but you don\u2019t hold your breath.\u201d\n\nPossible locations of coastal city rail stations in Palm Beach County:\n\nCities from Jupiter to Boca Raton are looking at locations for passenger stations on the Florida East Coast Railway tracks for the proposed Tri-Rail Coastal system. Some cities have designated locations, while others have conceptual plans. Where the stops could be:\n\nJupiter: Just south of Toney Penna Drive.Secondary stations possible near Indiantown Road and Frederick Small Road.\n\nPalm Beach Gardens: PGA Boulevard near Old Dixie Highway.\n\nRiviera Beach: 13th Street and Old Dixie Highway (west of the marina).\n\nWest Palm Beach: North side of Evernia Street just west of Quadrille Boulevard. (Same station would serve All Aboard Florida passengers.)\n\nLake Worth: South side of Lake Avenue (south of shuffleboard building). Secondary stations proposed south of 10th Avenue North and near Ninth Avenue South.\n\nLantana: Between Ocean Avenue and Lantana Road just west of Dixie Highway.\n\nBoynton Beach: Along Fourth Street between Boynton Beach Boulevard and Ocean Avenue.\n\nDelray Beach: North of Atlantic Avenue along Railroad Avenue.\n\nBoca Raton: North side of Northwest Second Street (south of Palmetto Park Road).\n\n2 rail passenger proposals\n\nTri-Rail Coastal - Short-hop commuter service that travels east of CSX tracks into heart of cities. Also would give passengers a way to get to All Aboard Florida.\n\nAll Aboard Florida - Passenger rail from Miami to Orlando, with stops only in West Palm Beach and Fort Lauderdale in between.

Noble says the supercharged car should hit 100mph in under seven seconds, and top out over 200mph.\n\nQuick enough, especially with a kerbweight estimated at 1,200kg (in comparison, the M600 weighs 1,250kg and musters 650bhp).

The top four jackpots have all been drawn roughly in the past year. That\u2019s largely due to California\u2019s recent addition to the game back in April, adding millions of potential players to the pool.\n\nDuring Saturday\u2019s drawing, a Milpitas ticket matched six numbers - but not the powerball \u2013 earning the buyer more than $1.1 million.\n\nThe state is the only guaranteed winner, it is expected to net $90-120 million a year from the sale of tickets. So how do you pick a winner? Were you planning on a quick pick? That\u2019s for rookies.\n\nAccording to USA Mega, the most common \u201cfirst five\u201d numbers drawn in the past 100 drawings are: 23, 26, 36, 08, 22.

Mandel is challenging U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown (D).\n\n\"Our concern was would he be able to beat Sherrod Brown, who has been in Washington for 20 years,\" Cincinnati Tea Party leader Ed Bell told HuffPost regarding concerns leaders had over Mandel. \"You hate to knock someone for their youth.\"\n\nBell said local and statewide conferences among 250 Tea Party groups around Ohio have led the Tea Party to officially back Mandel in recent days. Mandel is considered a top GOP prospect nationally in the Republican Party's bid to retake control of the U.S. Senate.\n\nBell said Mandel's position against Obama's health care reforms pleased the leaders. He said he believes that Mandel will lead the fight to repeal the act if it is upheld by the Supreme Court later this month, or will oppose any effort to restore the plan if the court overturns it.\n\n\"The guy is solid on repealing Obamacare,\" Bell said. \"He will fight like crazy to do that. That is the single top issue with Ohioans.\"\n\nDemocrats have been hitting Mandel for months over his hiring practices in the treasurer's office, his absence for a year of state Board of Deposit meetings, an FBI investigation into one of his campaign contributors and his refusal to discuss several pieces of Senate legislation. Brown has told HuffPost he believes conservative groups will spend more money on the race than liberal ones.\n\nBell and Cleveland-area Tea Party activist John McAvoy said they believe enthusiasm over Mandel will drive Ohio to favor Mitt Romney over Obama in the swing state. They said Ohio Tea Party activists may work to elect both. Last week, they noted, Romney's Ohio campaign staff asked Tea Party leaders to knock on 10,000 doors for the presidential candidate. The activists reached 25,000 doors. McAvoy noted that the Romney campaign strategy includes making contact with 250,000 voters across Ohio to discuss economic issues and to promote Romney's economic record.\n\nMcAvoy and Bell led a delegation of six Ohioans to Capitol Hill Monday afternoon to meet with Brown staffers to lobby the senator to oppose a bill to regulate coal ash. The pair, who did not schedule a meeting with Brown's staff in advance, said they believe the regulations would hamper jobs. They stressed they support the environment.\n\n\"Who doesn't want clean air?\" Bell said. \"It bothers me when someone says that we don't, but there has to be analysis on the impact on jobs.\"\n\nThe group met for 20 minutes with Brown staffers, where they said that they had a chance to press their agenda.

{"dataman_score": 4.0, "text": "Determinants of Courage\n\nby ishambat | September 26, 2012 at 06:51 pm\n109 views | 0 Recommendations | 0 comments\n\nOnce Dr. Phil played an episode in which he interviewed several people who had done courageous things and asked them to explain courage. I do not consider myself a courageous person, but I know a number of people who are highly courageous, and from what I've seen there appear to be several places from which courage can come.\n\nThe first one and most important one is competence. If you know how to run into a burning house and save someone without perishing, then you are more likely to do that than if you don't know how to do such a thing. Similarly the people who know what they're doing as soldiers are more likely to go to battle and perform in battle than people who don't know what they're doing as soldiers. Competence gives courage because it makes the person know that he can complete the task; and the biggest predictor of courage is competence.\n\nThe second is faith. Whether the faith is in God, or in the self, or in a political cause of which one is a part, faith gives the state of mind to do difficult and dangerous things. While the courage that comes from competence is confidence that one can complete the task, faith gives more of a borrowed courage: The belief that it is so important to do something that, even if one were to get negative confidences for it, it's still an act worthy of having done. For this reason we see any number of people without military or police training do brave things for any number of things that they may believe.\n\nAlso, there is courage that comes from desperation. This is where we find the expression \"Courage is a word for nothing left to lose.\" If there is nothing to look forward to, or if one's life is a muddle, then one doesn't stand to lose much by dying or being injured; which means that a person in that position can be highly courageous even if he normally is not.\n\nThese are the three main ones; but there are others sources of courage as well. One atypical source I've seen is compassion and caring. Compassion and caring brings a person to do things for others that are difficult and dangerous, even if those things bear no selfish reward. The people in this situation care so much about the next person, or about something external to themselves, that they would sacrifice much or risk much to assist or to set things right. And while there are some people who believe that compassion is for sissies, the people who are moved by compassion to do brave things are in fact the strongest and the best in the bunch.\n\nAnother source I've seen is the opposite of the preceding: Not caring. Some people are daredevils who don't care what happens to them and who like doing risky things for the rush. Some people are thrill-seekers, and that includes also those who deliberately put themselves in challenging situations in order to overcome challenge. Some people do not see this as real courage; however on occasion these people would do genuinely courageous things and apply their risk-seeking nature toward doing real good rather than simply seeking thrills.\n\nI am sure there are other things that drive courage; but these are the ones that I've seen personally. If I've missed something I invite people to add more.\n\n\nrecommend Sign In or Join to post comments\n\ncloseSign in to NowPublic\n\nis reporting from"}

It is not news that there is a war afoot against the use of tobacco in any form.\n\nJust recently, CVS, one of the largest retail pharmaceutical outlets in the nation, decided to rid its shelves of tobacco products. In the announcement, directors of the company said they realized removing tobacco products would cost the company billions in sales. That\u2019s a B as in billions.\n\nThus, one of the last bastions of \u201cover-the-counter\u201d or OTC \u201ccodger\u201d tobacco products and pipes is disappearing into thin air, signaling the end of an era.\n\nRead the rest of this entry \u00bb\n\nSo Many Blends \u2026 So Little Time\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0February 18th, 2014\n\nFred Brown\nAll right, so we all know that pipe smoking is good for your attitude.\nAnd it\u2019s brain food, right? It settles the nerves and puts you at peace with the world and those around you.\n\nYes, we know all that. That\u2019s why we are pipe smokers in the face of an increasing opposing public, Political Correctness Police and Anti-Extremists, etc., who are now even taking out the old \u201cdrug store\u201d blends from drug stores. Woe is me.\n\nOkay, so here is where we are going.

And in a time when states are looking to jump on the marijuana bandwagon in order to reap the revenue rewards, tobacco is being bashed by punitive taxes and bans across the spectrum.\n\nTobacco\u2019s early history has been pushed to the trash heap. Once, it was a crop this nation counted on to square its debts with foreign nations. It was a crop that was highly sought in foreign markets and sold worldwide. Kentucky burley tobacco was shipped to Europe in hogsheads and some of it returned to the U.S. in the form of pipe tobacco in the 18th and 19th Centuries. Does that sound familiar? It should.\n\nRead the rest of this entry \u00bb\n\nOn the Other Side of the Moon\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0January 14th, 2014\n\nFred Brown\nWell, it is a new pipe and tobacco year.\nThere were some surprises last year with the comeback of a couple of long-loved and highly missed Three Nuns and Capstan.

HOOPSWORLD caught up with him to discuss his game and give you a glimpse of his pre-draft workouts.\n\nWatch More Video Here\n\nRussell Westbrook Frustrated, But Supportive\n\nOklahoma City Thunder point guard Russell Westbrook had started every game of his collegiate and professional career before suffering a lateral meniscus tear in the first round against the Houston Rockets. Now, rather than helping his team make a deep postseason run, he\u2019s going through rehab and watching each game at the Chesapeake Energy Arena from a box since he can\u2019t be on the bench yet.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s tough, man,\u201d Westbrook said in his first interview since his injury. \u201cI don\u2019t want to let my team down. I want to compete. I love playing. I want to play in every game as long as I\u2019m able to and able to walk, but this time I wasn\u2019t able to walk and run like I was supposed to.\n\n\u201cI was disappointed, man. It was disappointing. You never want to be out the whole year. Especially [not being able to] help my team out during the playoffs. This is a time where guys play through everything and this is something that I couldn\u2019t play through. It\u2019s tough.\u201d\n\nWestbrook sustained the injury during the first half of Game 2 when he collided with Rockets guard Patrick Beverley. The very next play, Westbrook went coast-to-coast and scored a lay-up and he even finished the game. However, his pain increased at halftime and even more later that night once his adrenaline wore off.\n\n\u201cOnce it got to halftime it got real stiff,\u201d Westbrook said. \u201cSo it was tough for me to come back and start running again and jumping. But as the game went on and the crowd is going I\u2019m going to continue to play and try to find a way I can help.\n\n\u201cWhen I was playing on it I was basically playing on one leg, kind of just hobbling around. You probably could notice. I was kind of just hobbling around just trying to find a way where I can do what I can to help my team win. And at the same time I was in pain.\u201d\n\nWhen asked which is worse, the mental part of the physical part, Westbrook responded \u201cboth.\u201d\n\n\u201cI never had to rehab anything,\u201d Westbrook said. \u201cThis is tough, coming in doing the same thing every day. And then mentally, it can be tough. I mean, you\u2019ve got to keep your spirits high, stay positive and then come in with a mindset of trying to get better.\n\nHe admitted that he\u2019s still angry about how his season came to an abrupt end, but now he\u2019s focusing on helping on the Thunder in other ways. He\u2019s giving his replacement Reggie Jackson advice here and there as well as talking to the team in practice and at halftime. He and Kevin Durant still talk all of the time and discuss what the team needs to do to advance.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s tough, but as a point guard and a leader of this team my job is to find a way where I can help my teammates, the coaching staff and the organization,\u201d Westbrook said. \u201cThey\u2019ve been a big supporter of me and my job is to give it back. Help them out as much as I can and give my input. \u2026 Even though I\u2019m out, I still have a voice and I can help my team. Still find a way where I can communicate things to guys. Maybe they don\u2019t listen, maybe they do. But I still have a point to where I can use my voice and try to find a way where I can help my team.\u201d\n\nWestbrook has been impressed by Jackson, who had never played in a playoff game entering this postseason. Despite his inexperience, the 23-year-old has taken over as the starter in his sophomore season and has averaged 15.2 points, 4.2 rebounds and 3.0 assists since replacing Westbrook.\n\n\u201cReggie\u2019s done a great job of playing his game,\u201d Westbrook said. \u201cHe\u2019s been playing with good composure I think, especially going to Houston and taking care of those games and now getting ready to head to Memphis. I think he\u2019s done a great job of just controlling the game. Obviously, KD handles the ball a little more, but I think Reggie\u2019s done a great job of just being consistent and playing his game.\u201d\n\nEveryone has stepped up since Westbrook went down. Durant is commanding the ball and taking more shots, Jackson has assumed a bigger role and Kevin Martin has become the team\u2019s new second option. Serge Ibaka, Kendrick Perkins, Thabo Sefolosha and Nick Collison continue to lead the team defensively and fill their roles. With all of the talent that Oklahoma City still has, Westbrook believes the team can still represent the Western Conference in the NBA Finals and win a championship.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re tough, I think we have a tough group of guys,\u201d Westbrook said. \u201cWe\u2019re finding a way to win games. The group of guys we have, I think we have enough to get a ring. I honestly think we\u2019ve been together long enough to be able to figure things out when guys go down. You can see that.\u201d\n\nRight now, Westbrook is still very limited in what he can do. He can\u2019t work out, lift weights or even drive, so he spends most of his time watching movies, hanging out with his family and friends, and being around the team. However, as soon as he can resume workouts and basketball activities, Westbrook will work hard to become an even player. He also believes his time away from the game and new perspective as a fan can help him become a more efficient player.\n\n\u201c[I want to] come back better, a better player,\u201d Westbrook said. \u201cMentally, I think that\u2019s the biggest thing. Mentally it\u2019s going to be a big step for myself and moving forward with this team.\n\n\u201cI think I get an opportunity to sit back. This is my first time basically seeing the game from a different view. I may sit out for a few minutes here and there, but to kind of sit back and watch a whole game when I\u2019m not playing is different. This is my first time doing it, and it\u2019s something that can help me to see some of the things that maybe you guys see or somebody may see. The crazy shots I shoot or the time of possession (laughs). You can kind of see different things so I think it\u2019s good for me.\u201d\n\nWestbrook doesn\u2019t have a timetable for his return just yet. He\u2019ll get off of crutches in four-to-five weeks and then he\u2019ll have a better idea of when he\u2019ll be able to resume basketball-related activities. Game 3 between the Oklahoma City Thunder and Memphis Grizzlies is Saturday at 5 p.m. ET.\n\nJay Bilas On the 2013 NBA Draft\n\nThis year\u2019s draft class has been described as one of the weakest of all-time by some NBA decision-makers. However, just because the top of this draft is relatively weak compared to most years, that doesn\u2019t mean the entire class is bad. This draft is pretty deep and there are plenty of players who could develop into talented contributors at the next level.\n\nESPN college basketball analyst Jay Bilas agrees with that description of this year\u2019s class.\n\n\u201cNo question there will be some really good players that come out of this draft,\u201d Bilas told HOOPSWORLD\u2019s Lang Greene. \u201cI think if we started this draft at pick No. 10 then we\u2019d think it was really good when we talk about all the values there are in the draft. But the problem is we start it at No. 1 and in our culture we compare\u00a0 number one picks to each other and number five picks to number five picks. Well, this year\u2019s number one pick is not going to be as good as the number one pick from the 2003 draft [LeBron James] or the 2008 draft [Derrick Rose] or even last year\u2019s draft [Anthony Davis].\n\n\u201cSo if you compare it that way then of course it\u2019s going to be a down year. But if you start looking at values in the draft then I think there are some good ones across the board. There are fewer guys who you can see becoming a star, but there are lots of guys who are potential rotation players who could help you win, guys that have a chance to be very good down the road. If you took Dwyane Wade out of Marquette into this draft he would be the number one pick. He was the fifth pick in 2003 when he came out but the guy is a Hall of Famer. There is such a thing as better talent years, just like national champions or NBA champions some are stronger than others. We didn\u2019t have a great year for elite talents in college basketball, but there is still talent on the board.\u201d\n\nBecause there isn\u2019t a LeBron-type player in the 2013 draft, there is still some uncertainty at the top of the board. Which player will be the first selected on June 27? Most people say Nerlens Noel out of Kentucky, but Bilas thinks Ben McLemore out of Kansas is the better pick.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019d want to have the number one pick this year as opposed to some other years, but it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not going to get some good players if you\u2019re intelligent about your process,\u201d Bilas said. \u201cI tend to think the best all-around talent on the board is Ben McLemore from Kansas. I hear Nerlens Noel being discussed as being the top pick and that\u2019s absolutely legitimate because I think he would be a worthy top pick in this draft, but McLemore down the road has the potential to be the best player in his draft class.\u201d\n\nBilas is also a big fan of Otto Porter out of Georgetown and his sleeper in this draft is Pierre Jackson out of Baylor. Porter is projected to be a lottery pick while Jackson is projected to go late in the second round.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a big fan of Otto Porter because he\u2019s a different kind of player,\u201d Bilas said. \u201cI think he has a chance to come in and be a member of a successful team because he is so skilled and he defends at a high level.\n\n\u201cA guy like Pierre Jackson could come into the league and contribute even though he\u2019s only 5\u20199 or 5\u201910. You\u2019ll be able to put him into the game and change the tempo of the game and just be disruptive.\u201d\n\nThis year\u2019s draft features a number of one-and-done players including Noel, McLemore, Anthony Bennett, Shabazz Muhammad and Archie Goodwin. While some college basketball coaches and supporters have been against the one-and-done rule, Bilas has no problem with it.\n\n\u201cA lot of coaches say \u2018I don\u2019t want a one and done player,\u2019 well then you don\u2019t have to worry about it,\u201d Bilas said. \u201cWhat they\u2019re really saying is that they don\u2019t want to play against them either and that\u2019s where the problem comes in, that\u2019s where the moralizing comes in. You\u2019ve got too many people saying, \u2018I don\u2019t want this, this is not what college is about for me.\u2019 Well then run your school the way you want to because all we\u2019re doing is playing ball. So if you don\u2019t want to play on Saturday, then don\u2019t play. We\u2019re really quick to say to the player, \u2018Hey, if you don\u2019t like it you don\u2019t have to go to college.\u2019 Ok, if a coach doesn\u2019t like it they don\u2019t have to recruit a player. I don\u2019t understand what the handwringing is all about. For example, Kevin Durant, Derrick Rose or name any other player who stayed for only a year, they did not negatively impact the education of one other student. Not one. It actually enhanced the basketball program and it certainly enhanced the schools because both Texas and Memphis made a boatload of money off those players and continue to make a boatload of money off those players. So, I hardly think the one and done era is this travesty so many people think it is.\u201d\n\nTo read Bilas\u2019 thoughts on the debate about whether players should stay in school or enter the draft, check out Greene\u2019s NBA AM.\n\n\nURL to article: http://www.hoopsworld.com/nba-pm-westbrook-supportive-after-injury\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2013 HOOPSWORLD | Basketball News & NBA Rumors\nPart of the USA TODAY Sports Media Group."}

Rather than trying to shape the current code to be more favorable to savings and investment, grandiose schemes (Al Gore would call it a \u201crisky scheme\u201d) are floated to scrap the current system and replace it with something totally new.\u00a0\n\nThe latest proposal is the so-called \u201cFair Tax,\u201d which would replace the federal income tax with a national sales tax at a rate anywhere between 23 and 30 percent on all retail purchases. It has the endorsement of dark horse Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee and is the subject of much favorable comment from other Republican presidential candidates as well as support from grassroots anti-tax groups.\n\nUnfortunately, this campaign is an absolute waste of time and just gets politicians off the hook from making suggested changes that could actually be implemented within a reasonable time. Politicians should tell us what they can actually accomplish, not what they would like to see in a perfect world.\n\nWhy is the Fair Tax a cop-out? First, it will never happen, certainly not anytime soon. The current code is firmly embedded in every phase of American economic life and repealing it is not in our near future. Such talk makes good short-term politics, but cannot in any way be called a serious policy proposal.\n\nSecond, a national sales tax interferes with a major source of state and local revenue, and as such, will be opposed by every governor and mayor in the country.\n\nThird, it is less progressive than the current tax code and thus will be opposed by liberals and major interest groups that have a role in perpetuating the current system.\n\nFinally, given that the 16th Amendment is unlikely to be repealed, conservatives should want no part of a scheme that authorizes a national sales tax without taking away Congress\u2019s constitutional authority to levy an income tax. Otherwise, we\u2019ll probably wind up with both, given Congress\u2019s propensity to tax and spend.\n\nOur candidates owe us their thoughts on what they reasonably can accomplish during their time in office. The Fair Tax is not a serious idea. A far better idea for Republican candidates would be to tell us how they would preserve and deepen the Bush tax cuts, which are scheduled to expire in 2010, and which most Democrats have promised to cancel.\n\nMore in Economy & Budget\n\nBoost the Low Income Housing Tax Credit\n\nRead more \u00bb"}

Another reason they throw up, believe it or not, is because they get carsick and this can cause the dog to become sick to the stomach and throw up; to avoid this, don't take the dog out in the car right after he has eaten, give his stomach some time to settle.You will be able to notice when the dog is going to throw up because dogs usually start drooling more than normal, start licking their mouth and or swallow their saliva insistently. The best thing to do obviously is to keep a constant eye on what your dog eats and, if the dog does happen to throw up, check what he has vomited to try to identify what it is. If your dog throws up and you notice that it is just his normal food, most likely your dog just gobbled his food up too quickly, keep in mind though that this behavior usually occurs in dogs that are stressed out or feel insecure. If this is your dog's case you can help him out by serving him smaller portions of food or by changing his food little by little. Whenever a dog \"throws up\" food that has not yet been digested, he is not actually vomiting; he is just regurgitating his food.\n"}

It also means that the 18 percent of Twin Cities viewers who don't have cable or satellite will be left with only eight scheduled games airing nationally on the Fox network. Add in cable subscribers who only pay for the basic tier, which FSN is not part of, and you've got a lot of fans crying foul.\n\nOne of them is Adam Woolhouse. For years, the 31-year-old Bible salesman would wrap up yardwork and household chores on Saturday, leaving his Sunday afternoons free to watch his hometown baseball team on television.\n\nNo more. \"It leaves a bad taste in my mouth,\" Woolhouse said, adding that he doesn't plan to spend the money to upgrade his cable. \"It's not going to affect my love for the team. I know Ron Gardenhire and Joe Mauer didn't make the call. But it's going to affect what I think about management. The Twins have always been a small-market team and this screams of a big-market move.\"\n\n\n\"The days of significant packages with broadcast TV in sports are gone,\" he said.\n\nSports teams and cable are getting cozier because money can be gathered from both cable subscriptions and advertisers.\n\n\"It gives us the ability to maximize our investment,\" said FSN North general manager Mike Dimond.\n\nNeither Dimond or St. Peter would discuss financial details or the length of the deal. In a short statement, WFTC general manager Carol Rueppel said she was \"disappointed\" that the station would no longer carry games -- 25 of them last year -- but said she looked forward to the eight games on sister station KMSP, Ch. 9, which she also oversees.\n\nThe news isn't all bad for Twins fans. More games will be available in some form on TV -- at least 158 out of the 162 scheduled during the regular season. That compares to 133 in 2005. \"We're not withholding games,\" said Dimond, who boasted that Twins games are second only to the St. Louis Cardinals in regional ratings. \"They're there for people who want to find them.\"\n\nAlso, most cable subscribers sign up for more than just the basic tier. Dave Nyberg, a senior corporate affairs manager for Comcast, said that nearly 90 percent of his company's customers in Minnesota get FSN, which reaches more than 2 million homes across Minnesota and neighboring states.\n\nStill, some fans will feel stung by the change, but at least one is already searching for a bright side.\n\n\"This is the perfect excuse to listen to John Gordon's last season calling games on the radio,\" Woolhouse said. \u2022 612-673-7431 Follow Justin on Twitter: @nealjustin\n\n  \u2022 get related content delivered to your inbox\n\n  \u2022 manage my email subscriptions\n\n\nTV Listings\n\nEnter your zip code:\n\n\nAlready localized?

He went on trial Tuesday on charges of complicity to commit aggravated murder and conspiracy to commit aggravated murder.\n\nMcDonald was arrested in January, 2000, and indicted on an aggravated murder charge for the slaying of Joshua Buck, 24, of Walbridge Avenue. His body was found Dec. 25, 1999, in the bottom of a sewer in a wooded area at Southwood Road and Calvert Place near Bowsher High School. He was shot once in the head.\n\nHowever, the charge was dismissed because of problems in having potential witnesses available to testify and a delay in getting DNA evidence ready for trial.\n\nMcDonald was re-arrested March 9, four days after he was indicted for the second time in the Buck case - this time on the complicity and conspiracy charges.\n\nA jury listened to opening statements and heard the testimony of two witnesses on Tuesday. They returned to the courtroom of Judge Robert Christiansen yesterday to be told of a plea agreement.\n\nJudge Christiansen found McDonald of 1725 Winston Blvd. guilty and sentenced him to five years in prison, the maximum penalty for obstruction and the recommended sentence agreed upon in the plea agreement.\n\nAuthorities said Mr. Buck's death was the result of a bogus drug transaction designed to rob him of more than $30,000. Mr. Buck apparently thought he was going to buy 100 pounds of marijuana when he was killed late Christmas Eve.\n\nChad Beach of Toronto Avenue was convicted in March, 2002, of aggravated murder and sentenced to life in prison.\n\nIn entering his plea, McDonald provided a statement to the court that outlined his involvement in the murder. He said he met Beach in the early hours of Dec. 25, 1999, in the parking lot of an apartment complex.\n\nHe said Beach was driving the victim's SUV, and he saw blood on the back seat. He said he took a bag of clothing from Beach and burned the items.\n\nHe also said he lighted gasoline in the sewer about five days before the killing in an attempt to hide the impending scent of a body.\n"}

He looked straight into my eyes, patted me on the shoulder and fiercely said \u201cAny manager can do more work with more resources; only good managers can do more with less\u201c. Okay, strike the shoulder and fierce thing, this is just my father complex kicking in.\n\nHowever, the same idea also applies to photography, and especially starting photographers where big dollars equipment is rare.\n\nIn the story below Martin Kimeldorf (Flickr) shares a lesson on making more with less. Actually, Martin managed to double the amount of light sources he has with just a bit of imagination.\n\nIn this example I made my own V-cards or Book End reflectors. I used something a bit smaller, a 3 x 6 foot white corrugated material. That I can get in my vehicle. As you know, Studio V cards can come in as big as you can get make \u2018em.\n\nAnd sometimes for me DIY becomes a blend. In this case I modify and existing product\u00a0 to fit my situation better. To that end I recently modified a PressLite Vertex by creating a new base for it. This meant cutting off the top of a dome diffuser and fitting the PressLite to it. That way I can quickly mount and dismount this specialized strobe modifier as I go. I also have made a similar modification to a lumiquest softbox.\n\nDoing More With Less - Photography Studio Lights\n\nAnd other times DIY means doing more with less. A good example is the home studio DIY theme recently appearing here on DIYP.\n\nIn the example pictures I\u2019m trying to use 2 strobes to create some interesting light that might normally take 4 different lights. Here is setup:\n\nDoing More With Less - Photography Studio Lights\n\nFirst double power is done using a PRESSLite Vertex. If you closely look at the strobe on the back left, you\u2019ll see that one half is gelled blue and sent to a home made backdrop stand. The forward side of the strobe is gelled with CTO to case a warm glow and sent to the ever moving model mannequin side/back for rim light.\n\nThen I added a double gelled lumiquest softbox to further illuminate the scene. Here is the nice thing. The light from the lumiquested flash can be played with:\n\nIn the first image I did not do a thing \u2013 light falls as it may.\n\nDoing More With Less - Photography Studio Lights\n\nIn the second image I forced no light at all from the right side by using the dark side of the v-card.\n\nDoing More With Less - Photography Studio Lights\n\nAnd lastly, I reflected some light back to the mannequin by using the reflecting side of the v-card.\n\nDoing More With Less - Photography Studio Lights\n\nLastly, here is an image of the setup while strobes are firing. It is the best way to see the split Vertex effect.\n\nDoing More With Less - Photography Studio Lights"}

My eye contact never really felt real untollerable until I started smoking weed ( had a couple panic attacks while out with others), and the last time I did shrooms.\nIt is similar to what is being talked about with the eye contact except I felt like I was getting sucked into their faces, into their eyes in a very intense way.\n\nI can socialize great sitting in a car, not looking at someone, but when eye contact is involved, becomes very difficult.\nmistamista is offline \u00a0 Reply With Quote\nOld 03-06-2010, 04:58 AM \u00a0 #23 (permalink)\nStatus: SAS Member\nJoin Date: Feb 2010\nPosts: 10\n\n\nOriginally Posted by AndyLT View Post\nWell Scofield, I know exactly what you are going through.\n\nYou don't have a fear of making eye-contact. You have a fear of giving strange/tense eye-contact. To be more precise, you fear negative reaction from others about the way your eyes look. And the fear of producing tense eye-contact actually does that.\n\nStargirl described the same process in different settings. The fear itself causes the feared results.\n\nSo, Scotfield, I have the same issue. I believe, that this problem has to do something with SA, but it's being fueled by catch22 circular thinking more, than negative beliefs or thoughts. I guess, you (just like me) know that your eyes are perfectly OK, when they are relaxed.\n\nThe only technique that seems to be working substantially, I've discovered, is called Paradoxical Intention. Though, I've been applying it only for a month.\n\nAnd man, I know how much this ridiculous thingy sucks and damages social life.\n\nHi Andy, well it's comforting to see that other people are going through it too.\n\nConcerning Paradoxical Intention, how do you do it exactly?\n\nBecause using this tehcnique w'd mean looking at people in a really weird way and scare them.\nBut the \"social rules of behavior\" prohibit it. And people will always avoid you in the future.\n\nSo how do you do and it is working for you?\n\nScofield is offline \u00a0 Reply With Quote\nOld 03-07-2010, 01:34 AM \u00a0 #24 (permalink)\nSAgirl's Avatar\nStatus: SAS Member\nJoin Date: Nov 2003\nLocation: Northwestern Ontario\nGender: Female\nAge: 35\nPosts: 3,293\n\n\nI think that we can't make eye contact since we are always so self focused and wondering what people think of us all the time. Plus, we think of that every thing is a social threat all the time and that really screws up our opportunity to want to get close to others. I worry about my own startle reactions as well and I am uncomfotable about them. Plus, we are sensitive to rejection.\n\nMaybe, if you worry about repulsing others you wil have to work on your self-esteem.\nMy eye contact is bad, too.\nSAgirl is offline \u00a0 Reply With Quote\nOld 03-07-2010, 02:17 AM \u00a0 #25 (permalink)\npikabird's Avatar\nStatus: SAS Member\nJoin Date: Mar 2010\nAge: 23\nPosts: 65\n\n\ni am very afraid of making eye contact... for some reason i just get so tongue tied when i'm looking someone in the eye. i only have speech and conversation comprehension problems when i'm making eye contact so i naturally avoid it.\npikabird is offline \u00a0 Reply With Quote\nOld 12-10-2011, 02:39 PM \u00a0 #26 (permalink)\nStatus: SAS Member\nJoin Date: Dec 2010\nPosts: 9\n\n\nstares is offline \u00a0 Reply With Quote\nOld 03-20-2012, 05:23 AM \u00a0 #27 (permalink)\nStatus: SAS Member\nJoin Date: Sep 2011\nPosts: 2\n\nDefault Eye contact, watery eyes, SA\n\nHi guys,\n\nI was an active member of this site for a while last year when my SA had got so out of control I was beyond desperate. It's awful isn't it how something as slimy and seemingly uncontrolable can get the better of you.\n\nAnyway I wont make this long, just want to quickly share my experiences of the lats 6 mnths.\n\nI had a terrible problem with making eye contact (which hasnt completely vanished) and being close to people, especially loved ones, and I had transformed into a person whom in my early and mid 20's was a social beats and 'life of the party' kind of guy to a nervous and shy shell of a person.\nThere was also a healthy dose of OCD that Ive had since teen yrs, this not so much a concern as its manageable. Don't exactly know how this came about or why, combination of some bad experiences and some bad people maybe.\n\nI refused to go any further the direction this was taking me, which would have eventually been complete isolation and emotional exhaustion. I still shudder remembering the worst of it.\nI decided I needed to see a psychologist and or Dr of some sorts.\n\nI started on a 4 mnth cognitive behavioral therapy plan with this psyc. It did a bit of good to help get things sorted out in my head and to at least get things off my chest, a huge relief as Im sure many of you know.\n\nNow just to confirm what I'm about to say is not an endorsement for drugs or 'taking the easy way out', but it is my experience none the less.\nI was advise to try a low dosage of anti depressant Zorloft which is known to help with SA and OCD both. I was desperate to try everything and so i definitely wanted to give it a go and did.\nSome necessary side affects aside, it was really the turning point in my battle of dealing with these illnesses.\n\nMy OCD eased off and most of all I found the drug eventually after about 4 weeks helped me maintain a level of happiness and security that helped me deal with a lot of my **** in a better head space. I suppose it gave me more courage and slightly easier platform to be able to work with.\nMy SA eased off and I suppose my better frame of mind helped me be more adventurous in trying out new techniques and just going for it. Courage I suppose is what I mean, it gave me courage which I needed, desperately.\n\nAnyway I stayed on the drugs for 3 months which I deemed a fairly short period but enough for me to really feel the difference. I think the best senarios with these drugs is that they are a temporary solution and provide a releif so you can deal with your strategies of getting better -well 'better'.\n\nNow that I'm off them I can honsetly say I feel they have done me good and I've gained some really positive esteem and self confidence due to them, or rather they provided a bridge to allow me to get to a better place where I can deal with things more rationally. You can't deal with your demons and insecurities well enough when your that sick - its just too hard, you need some help. Thats my experience I find.\n\nI suppose what I want to say from this is that each of us had our own very specific and individual pain and struggle. If your really adamant in getting better and/or getting help, drugs can really help with this and give you the strength you need. They are of course not a final answer or solution on the matter, but they bloody helped me. They may not have the same effect on you, but you know what, they just might, and maybe even better. If your considering the use of drugs for anything from OCD to SA to depression/anxiety I wholeheartedly recommend giving the drug option a go and Zorloft was a good one for me.\n\nHappy to receive any messages and happy to share my experiences.\n\ngood luck and best wishes,\nrosenkavalier is offline \u00a0 Reply With Quote\nOld 11-08-2012, 11:21 AM \u00a0 #28 (permalink)\nStatus: SAS Member\nJoin Date: Nov 2012\nPosts: 13\n\nDefault Yes it's treatable! with determination!\n\nI have done a lot of research, over the years, about this. I too suffer from the \"condition\" started slowly when I was about 14 and it progressively made itself dominant in my life the older I got. (apparently that is common, so i've read) I'm 27 now. yea....good times :/ I too contemplated and plotted suicide, but realized that I'm more afraid of God than I am of people. God has a purpose for my life. His word tells us that suicide is wrong. Therefore, I have forced myself to endure this and overcome it.\nThere are many other websites/forums/blogs where people are coming forward about this. I read one book in particular about a woman who suffered from severe anxiety and social phobia. Her story is much more extreme than mine and probably many of yours but she digs into the science of what happens in the brain to cause certain behaviors. She, apparently, would have extreme nervous breakdowns. I don't recommend buying it. I skimmed through a lot of it because she rambles and it's disorganized. the book is titled \"A Spider in the Palace\" by Jeanne Pricer. It's not the easiest book to follow but I was desperate for any answers. Here is what I have learned so far and what I plan to do about it:\nBasically, this is something we have trained our brains and eyes to do. After the first time it happened, a memory was recorded in our brains of that moment. (I can remember specifically the first few times it happened to me and all the other times, as i'm sure most of you can) Due to the awkwardness of the situation, embarrassment and fear, we we're doomed to recall that incident the next time we were in a social situation, causing us to panic and repeat the behavior. It probably only took one or two incidents for us to create what is called \"MUSCLE MEMORY\". Each time you are forced to speak to someone, your brain recalls what happened and repeats the behavior. It's like a reflex. I and others i've read about, recognize that it is \"out of our control\" and there are no other thoughts besides \"DON'T DO IT\" going on in our heads during each encounter. The wonderful thing about muscle memory is that it can be trained to do something new! I read on another website similar to this one that someone had found a way to slowly overcome it....\nShe said she read a book that gave an exercise to practice daily in order to learn maintaining eye contact. She wrote that the book said to find someone you trust or someone you can at least talk to about this and ask them if they would be willing to sit down with you each day and have a \"staring contest\". lol Well, kinda. You sit directly across from this person, and look into their eyes WITHOUT looking away for 5-15 minutes. While you are looking in their eyes, put your mind at ease that there is nothing to be paranoid about. Make it fun and enjoyable, train your brain to recognize social interaction as something POSITIVE, not something to be feared. Even if you look away, immediately regain eye contact and tell yourself thats its ok to break eye contact once in awhile.\n\nAfter a few days of sitting in silence, try holding a conversation with them without breaking the eye contact. Practicing listening to them instead of thinking too much. Ultimately that is what we do to ourselves to worsen our condition. Do what works for you until you feel comfortable. Knowing that you can trust this person not to judge you will help to eliminate the fear. Also keep in mind that this is only to be practiced with someone who understands why you are not breaking eye contact (basically, don't do it without their consent). In a normal social setting, it's perfectly acceptable to only look someone in the eye occasionally. People who never break eye contact are over achievers in my mind and make me very uncomfortable. lol.\n\nI am lucky enough to have my husband to console about this. He's the only one that I have ever shared it with. Never mentioned it to my counselor but I would recommend a counselor to anyone who doesn't have someone they can trust. There are some in churches and schools that are free. Look online too. My insurance covers mine. If anything, try using a camera or mirror until you find someone to tell.\n\nTalking to someone about it is very embarrassing, i know, but being alone in this is unhealthy. Maybe ask someone on here that shares the same condition to do it through skype or w/e....They definitely could help and wont judge!!\n\nMy counselor said it takes 90 days of consistent new thoughts to re train your brain and about 3-4 weeks to retrain muscles. So if you do this exercise daily (at least try to) and also keep a journal of positive thinking (each morning or before going to bed, write down positive thoughts about yourself and what you've been blessed with) you will see a difference. Pray that God will help you overcome this! Stay positive.\nif you have trouble staying positive, an excellent book to read is \"Battlefield of the Mind\" by Joyce Meyer. She is a FANTASTIC author and it's her #1 seller.\nI have made tremendous strides!! and I have accepted this as something i will probably struggle with from time to an alcoholic or someone with bipolar disease. It should comfort you knowing you are not alone. It's much easier to walk through something when you know you aren't alone. I am determined and confident that this...thing...will not keep me down. I strongly believe God has asked me to endure this for a reason. As with any other trial a person must endure, we will be stronger because of it. A quote from joyce meyer that has given me strength and hope is:\n\n\"Courage is not the absence of fear, it's action in the presence of it\".\n\nEach time you face your fear and speak to someone (regardless of what happens during the conversation) you are living proof of true courage. Let that be your inspiration and hope. Continue seeking advice and help from others. You are not a freak!!! I used to say that to myself constantly. It's not true!! You are perfect in God's eyes and he loves you! and that is all that matters!\n\nGood luck and God bless.\nLittleMiss is offline \u00a0 Reply With Quote\nOld 11-08-2012, 03:35 PM \u00a0 #29 (permalink)\nlost91's Avatar\nStatus: \u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\nJoin Date: Oct 2011\nLocation: Florida\nGender: Male\nAge: 22\nPosts: 1,044\n\n\nI hate making eye contact especially while driving\nlost91 is offline \u00a0 Reply With Quote\n\nThread Tools\n\nPosting Rules\nYou may not post new threads\nYou may not post replies\nYou may not post attachments\nYou may not edit your posts\n\nBB code is On\nSmilies are On\n[IMG] code is On\nHTML code is Off\nTrackbacks are Off\nPingbacks are Off\nRefbacks are Off\n\nSimilar Threads\nThread Thread Starter Forum Replies Last Post\nAny specific ideas how to get rid of eye contact phobia?

(Director Denial still had a paddle of flesh on one side, and a thumb and index finger on the other - sufficient surface area with which to gather up her skirts.) As many posters have already pointed out, it is the \"Mythology of Us.\" Facts and fiction wrapped up together, assembled in a way that attempts to makes sense of the chaos of life.\n\nAnyway... The Nightmare Box is a work of fiction, an extended metaphor by Tess Clark to explain what happened to her daughter - a placeholder for the 'real' explanation she would learn when she gathered the courage to put herself in the same position Cassandra had.

Are you by chance going to be at the Cubs game next Tuesday night and/or Wednesday afternoon?\n\nYou are?\n\nWell, great\u2026ME TOO.\n\nIf you want to meet up during a game or before hand/afterwards, let me know and let\u2019s see what we can work out! Not sure where I\u2019m sitting as of yet, but I will be there taking in the last two games of the homestand\u00a0against the Rockies at Wrigley. As of now, looks like I\u2019ll catch Russell Tuesday night and then Coleman on Wednesday (ok, Soto will do the catching, but you know what I mean). Would have been great to see Wells/Cashner, but they are no where near ready to come back yet. Hopefully we see them on the mound at Wrigley again soon.\n\nI\u2019ll keep this post updated as I find out more! Go Cubs Go!\n\nUPDATE \u2013 4/27 7:25pm CST: An amazing day today in Chicago. Aside from coming to town to catch two games against the Rockies at Wrigley, I also had a couple meetings scheduled. I\u2019m happy to say I will have some exciting news to share very soon. Regarding the games, today\u2019s game against the Rockies was postponed until June 27th. No refunds or exchanges so I\u2019ll probably be back in town to catch the make up game. I was at Wrigley long enough to eat another amazing tray of nachos (seriously, they must be the best in MLB) and take more photos to post on the blog. Those will be up in the next days or so. Looking forward to sharing them with you. It wasn\u2019t raining very hard and the tarp never came off the field. I felt good about a 1:20pm start because of all the hours left in the day to start the game late if need be. However, I think teams\u2019 travel schedules start to get in the way and unfortunately due to a lack of break in the poor weather and the fact that both teams would travel tonight, they called it. Flying out in the morning. Had a blast. Check back here in the next couple days for photos and more details about the trip. I\u2019ll be scheduling another trip for May sometime and of course will look to come back to catch that make up game for a trip back in June among other return visits to the ballpark this season. Looking forward to it already. Go Cubs Go!\n\nUPDATE \u2013 4/26 10:50pm CST: Just got in from the Cubs game. Wrigley is the best place to watch a baseball game, hands down. Always more fun to see them win, but considering the way the weather was today, good to see a game at all. Didn\u2019t turn out much better than my simulated version on PS3. Rockies beat the Cubs 4-3. Helton proved to be too much for the young Jedi, Russell and Soriano\u2019s bottom of the ninth blast came leading off with no one on and came up short in the end. Russell doesn\u2019t seem to be the long term answer as he didn\u2019t get through five yet again although he threw his career high, 82 pitches. Took a ton of pictures and will have a lot more to say when I post after tomorrow\u2019s game later this week. Also, for some reason my phone won\u2019t allow me to access Twitter so if you follow me and were looking for in-game tweets, that\u2019s why there weren\u2019t any. I\u2019ll update this again though after the 1:20pm CST game tomorrow. Hopefully I\u2019ll get to sing Go Cubs Go at Wrigley before the my trip is over. Go Cubs Go. Let\u2019s raise that W flag tomorrow.\n\nUPDATE \u2013 4/26 1:10pm CST: Hanging out at my friend\u2019s place where I\u2019m staying these couple days. Played Rockies/Cubs on PS3, MLB 2K11. Russell pitched a great game but bullpen blew it late. Was up 2-1 going into the 8th on a Soriano home run. Ended up losing 5-2. Good thing it didn\u2019t count\u2026and hopefully it doesn\u2019t end up counting as the only Cubs game I see today. Raining pretty hard in Chicago right now. That\u2019s the bad news. Good news is it\u2019s only 1:10 and today\u2019s game time is 7pm. We\u2019ll see. Hey Chicago, whaddaya say, how about we stop this rain today?\n\nUPDATE \u2013 4/25 10:30am CST: I will be sitting in section 110 at the Tuesday night and Wednesday afternoon games. Third base side 1\u201910\u2032. I may not have a jersey with the 10 patch on it, but I think it\u2019s cool the first games I\u2019ll see at Wrigley\u00a0this year are going to be third base side, 110. Flying in honor of Mr. Cub. Root, root, rooting in honor of\u00a0Mr. Santo. Go Cubs Go!\n\nUPDATE \u2013 4/21 9:50pm CST: Found out I\u2019ll be in Row 14 on my flight there and back. I shall snack and read thousands of feet about the ground in honor of Mr. Cub.\n\nAbout these ads\n\nOne thought on \u201cProse and Ivy is at Wrigley Next Week.

Adding, \u201cSpecifically, shea butter processors, nut pickers, local agents and manufacturers of shea nut roasting equipment faced a reduction in output and income\u201d.\n\nThe 2008/2009 financial crisis is said to have had debilitating effects on small and medium enterprises (SMEs) globally. However, the extent to which the crisis generally affected SMEs in Ghana and its shea industry in particular is not well known. In October 2010, the UNDP, Accra office, commissioned a study to examine the impact of the global financial crisis on the shea industry in Ghana with emphasis on the channels of transmission and how small and medium scale enterprise owners responded to the crisis.\n\nThe study aimed at reviewing literature on the impact of global economic crisis on the performance of SMEs; identifying key players in Ghana\u2019s shea industry with the aim of knowing the nature and extent of the impact of the crisis on each of them; critically analyzing the specific channels of transmission of the impact; investigating the crisis adjustment strategies adopted by the various key players in the industry; and providing policy recommendations.\n\nIndeed, the shea industry in Ghana occupies an important place in the economic development agenda of the country, because of its role in job creation, industrial development and growth of national economy. Besides, the shea industry can promote regional development in Africa.\n\nThe report dubbed The Impact Of The Economic Crisis On Local Small And Medium Industries: The Case of Shea Butter Industry In Ghana\u201d, which was conducted by the Centre for Continuing Education and Inter-disciplinary Research (CCEIR) of the University for Development Studies (UDS) for UNDP was presented recently at a workshop in Tamale for validation.\n\nThe study was conducted in 14 communities in Northern and Upper West regions of Ghana including 4 districts namely; Tamale Metropolis and West Mamprusi District in Northern Region and Wa Municipal and Nadowli District in the Upper West region.\n\nAccording to Dr. Seidu Al-hassan, Director of CCEIR of UDS who presented the report, shea butter processors also complained about the increased unemployment due to poor market conditions coupled with a reduction in household purchasing power as a result of low domestic market for shea commodities amidst high inflation and cost of borrowing rates. Adding, \u201cFor instance, average quantity of shea butter produced fell by 49%; average price of shea nut reduced from GH\u00a20.90 per bowl to GH\u00a2 0.80 and about 5% of the women complained about the collapse of their working capital. Also, in Tamale the average number of bags sold during the crisis, were 2 and 5 bags after the crisis representing about 150% increase.\u201d Besides, the Gurugu Tiehisuma women shea butter processing centre collapsed because of local agents who had failed to pay for an amount of shea butter worth GH\u00a21,300 bought on credit. This led to 70% job losses, Dr. Seidu said disclosing further that \u201c13 shea butter processors out of 43 belonging to Gumo Women shea butter processing group completely exited. 45 out of 75 individual shea butter processors of the Malshegu Women shea butter processing group also exited whereas over 80% of shea butter processors cut down production by way of coping.\u201d\n\nHe explained that the evidence surprisingly showed that companies that exported shea nut and butter did not suffer much partly due to the fact that they had enough stock to meet international market demand during the crisis period.\n\nCredit institutions including rural banks and microfinance institutions according to the report, suffered from declining loanable funds, high loan default rates, reduced outreach programmes and increased operational costs due to the crisis. This invariably affected the shea sector seriously, because the credit institutions became reluctant to provide credits to households and business enterprises for fear of default.\n\nThe report urged policymakers to focus on interventions that link small business owners in the shea industry to reliable markets rather than focusing on the supply side, adding that emphasis should be placed on strengthening existing markets while creating new ones. For instance, it said the market for shea butter in the African sub-region is low and this should be strengthened in order to encourage regional trade in shea commodities, stressing that \u201cthe government of Ghana can also support procurement by buying shea commodities from small enterprises\u201d.\n\nThe report finally implored entrepreneurs in the shea butter sub-sector to be more aggressive and proactive in seeking out and exploiting new business opportunities. Aside value addition which is a strategy being adopted by some entrepreneurs, the report advocated that there was the need to develop their capacity further in key areas such as resource mobilization, efficiency of resource allocation, market opportunity identification, product quality promotion and business development.\n\nNo comments:\n\nPost a Comment"}

{"dataman_score": 4.0, "text": "Monday, September 2\n\nThe (Erroneous?) Need for Speed\n\nSome of my favourite games are quick ones. I've played well over 200 games of Carcassonne & Magic: The Gathering, over 100 games of Race for the Galaxy and getting on for a hundred games of 7 Wonders. What do they have in common apart from being great games? Speed. They can be played quickly enough that you could play several games back-to-back. And in the days before The Daughter, The Wife and I would frequently play these games over and over.\n\nOne of my stated goals for Codename: Vacuum is to make it quick to play, so that if I ever get it to the point where it's a great game, people will be inclined to play it over and over. Over the last few months, even playing with Dave and Chief (who've both played over 40 games of Vacuum) the play time was around 25 minutes per player (50 minutes for a two-player game, 1:15 for a three-player game). Not only did I struggle to juggle my hours at work to fit these games in, in my mind this was failing to hit the sweet spot. I can play a two-player game of Race for the Galaxy in 20 minutes. I can play a three-player game of 7 Wonders in less than half an hour - these games benefit from simultaneous player actions, and as a result can be very fast with experienced players who don't suffer from analysis paralysis. That is hitting the sweet spot in my personal opinion. So over the last couple of months I've been trying to tweak the rules to Vacuum to pep it up a bit and decrease the play time.\n\nThe August version of Vacuum was finished in time for the inaugural Newcastle Playtest session at the beginning of the month, and since then I've been crafting the re-written rules ready to give my friend Paul in York an updated version of Vacuum, replacing the version I gave him back in April. Paul was up in Newcastle a few weeks ago to visit us and meet The Daughter, and during the visit I asked about their experiences with Vacuum. Apparently it had been played a number of times, but one of the major criticisms was that at around 45 minutes per player (!) it felt too long for what it was. No doubt! Clearly it needs knocking up a notch.\n\nWell, we're in York for a few days this week for The Wife's work, so we're staying with Paul and his family, experiencing the wonders of his Games Night (which I used to attend twice a week regularly back when we lived in York). I've done the new rules, and though I didn't have time to make a new copy of the game, I can give him my copy, complete with new rulebook, and then I'll make myself a replacement on my return (once the pressure's off!).\n\nI've now played the August version three times, once with two new players at the Playtest meetup (the impromptu second one, I missed the inaugural one), once with Dave a couple of weeks ago and once with Chief last week. The first of those games (with the simple rules) lasted about 45 minutes - 15 minutes per player. The second lasted 34 (17 minutes per player) and the third only 20 minutes (10 minutes per player). Awesome!\n\nOr is it?\n\nAfter I played with Dave a couple of weeks ago he expressed concern that the game was too short now. It felt less epic to him and he missed the chance to fully explore his chosen strategy (which is inevitably raining plasma doom on my inocuous backward empire with a wave upon wave of overly aggressive Armadas). His fear was the shorter game would strip several strategies of their usefulness, since you wouldn't have time in the game to get them started before the game's swift conclusion.\n\nThis week I played with Chief. He won. For the first time in approximately forty games. Dave and I were beginning to wonder if it would ever happen. Was he intentionally taking it easy on us? Did he have a phobia of winning games? (what's that even called?) Had he been lobotomised as a child, and had the winning parts of his brain removed? It turns out none of these. He won. He beat me at a game I'd designed. And he did it in 20 minutes. Schooled.\n\nDave's thoughts on his epic victory, after finally crushing the designer at his own game? He felt the game was too short!\n\nI'd really enjoyed the game. We'd been flying through it. Each player's turn regularly taking a handful of seconds. Almost no downtime. It felt like playing Race for the Galaxy against The Wife or 7 Wonders with Terry and Andrew. Blisteringly fast. On top of that, Chief had chosen the Exploration strategy (which can be quite slow) and had got as far as Proxima Centauri, which is quite an achievement as it's particularly hard to reach and requires a real concerted effort to get there. \"Ha!\", I thought, \"See Dave, even in twenty minutes, Chief managed to reach Proxima, the shorter game isn't too short.\"\n\nThen Chief pissed on my chips and agreed with Dave that the game was too short. He enjoys the chance to explore a wealth of strategies and diversify your deck - possible in the longer game, but not in the new shorter version.\n\nSo here's a question. I've reduced the game length to my 'ideal' length. I enjoyed the feel of it the three times I've played it. But the two guys who've played it more than anyone else, who play it week in, week out at work, both don't like the changes. Do I cave in and extend the game again, to increase the epic feel, and the wealth of strategies you can explore in a single game? Or do I stick to my guns and ride with the shorter game, possibly admitting that the only two people who will regularly play the game with me might not be the target audience for the game?\n\nI'm going to have to play the shorter rules a few more times, with Dave and Chief if they're up for it to see if they come round to the shorter game, but also with more people, to see if Dave and Chief are in the majority or the minority...\n\nIn other news, the second Newcastle Playtest Meetup is this Tuesday in The Bridge Hotel again. I'll not be there, but don't let that put you off!\n\n\nGavin said...\n\nHey Jack, there are probably a few things going on here that's clouding the issue (IMO, I'm no game designer!)...\n\nWith Dave and The Chief, they've wracked up 40+ games. Play testing or not, they've invested into the previous \"style\". They're accustomed to it. A significant change to the scale of the game could easily be a bit of a \"shock\". Not to mention, if I was The Chief, I'd want to beat you at the previous version I'd been sucking at, not this new, faster version :)\n\nFor yourself, you've got a specific time-goal in mind. You water to be able to play it \"quickly\". Making some changes that lead to a quicker game are definitely in line with that goal. Naturally, you'll be placing the changes in context of the overall game experience, but quicker play is something to latch on to.\n\nFor your friend Paul, he's an experienced game player, but has been playing with a not-yet-finished game, with a not-so-great rule book... Unlike your other play testers, he hasn't had the close interaction with the designer, whilst playing. Questions and ambiguities aren't easily answered; quickly answered. Weighing in at 40+ minutes per player is maybe longer than it would \"normally\" be. We're everything finished, or he'd been playing with you, he might have experienced 25/30 mins per player, rather than 40+.\n\nThree opinions/data points, but all biased in some way. The ideal of course would be to have two versions of the game side by side, the longer, epic version, and the one target at 10/15 mins per player. Run those on two separate groups, large groups, and get a feel for which version is closest to the\"great\" that you're aiming for.\n\nPlay testing on that scale probably isn't an option ;)\n\nYou're the designer of Vacuum, what's most important to you? Over time you've developed a theme, the mechanics, a 'style' for the game. All that is Vacuum, to date. As it has evolved, it's been (I think) resisting against one of e key goals that you have - a quick game.\n\nIs the current design at odds with a fast game?\n\nI think you can make either work. The current game as it stands, in my opinion, is strong. Is on the way to great. I like the fundamental mechanism (it's better than Thunderstone, the mechanism, in my opinion) and its got the addictive \"need to play my next turn, now\"...\n\nAs you've asked in this post, does it matter that its not as fast as Race or 7 Wonders? Personally I don't think so. But I'm viewing that from an end users point of view. The end user has many games to select from, some short, some longer and some epic. I just one good examples of each kind, of each length category.\n\nBut you're the designer. In this debate, you're considering one game only.\n- do you want to make a great game?\n- or do you want to make a great game, that's also fast to play?\n\nPick one, then iterate to great ;)\n\n\nJack said...\n\nHiya Gav,\n\nWow! I thought my post might have been too long, but your comment is almost as long as the post!\n\nYour points are all good ones, I'm aware that everybody comes with their own biases.\n\nI think I'm going to have to slow it down a bit, but I don't want to slow it down much, I'd like it to be quicker than it has been up until a couple of weeks ago.\n\n\n\nGavin said...\n\nHey Jack,\n\non reflection, that was a long comment!

Previously I was using a 3 person tent (Sierra Designs Zia 3) which I really like, but after several trips decided that it would be nice to have some additional head room so that I could stand up when changing clothes, and when entering/exiting. Because of the quality of the Zia 3 I figured it was a good \"bet\" to stick with a Sierra Designs product. Well, I was right. Why? I am 5'9\" and if I just bend my head ever so slightly I can stand up in the center, and when entering/exiting. The ease of set up is really outstanding. It's just as easy as the smaller Zia 3. I don't normally like sleeves and was a bit concerned about threading poles through them, because I've had issues with other sleeve designed tents in the past, but no concerns with this tent. Sleeves are short (ergo poles also) and it is a quick,simple process to do. Quality of poles, fabric, clips, etc. is 1st rate in all respects. Embarrassingly spacious for one person even with my side bags, truck bag, riding gear, etc. inside. I plan to be camping in comfort for many years to come using this, I mean tent!\n\n    \u2022 What Is Your Gear Style:\n    \u2022 Comfort Driven\n    \u2022 Was this a gift?:\n    \u2022 No\n\n    Lighter Weight Space and Comfort\n\n    By\u00a0Ol Bones Geologist\n\n    from Lawrence, Kansas\n\n    Verified Buyer\n\n\n    \u2022 Comfortable\n    \u2022 Easy To Set Up\n    \u2022 Fly Works Well\n    \u2022 Sturdy\n    \u2022 Waterproof\n    \u2022 Windproof\n\n\n      Best Uses\n\n      \u2022 Backpacking\n      \u2022 Car Camping\n\n\n      As I have gotten older, \"comfort\" or rather more comfort is a consideration when back-packing and/or casual car camping. And for my ol bones, being able to nearly stand up in a light(er) weight yet sturdy tent is a critical element in defining comfort. I also appreciate being able to set up a cot if I so desire. I simply could no longer do the fetal maneuvers necessary inside a shorter two man back-packing tent. The tent would work well for backpacking provided you split the load up between backpackers. I've pitched the tent and it is relatively easy to set up and while the tent is easy to set up, I generally prefer clip designs as opposed to pole- sleeve designs. However, this design works well and with the abundance of mesh, it has great ventilation. With the guy-points staked out (a must in my opinion) it is steady in blustery conditions and since we have had a boat-load of rain (thunderstorms actually) recently, I can attest to the water-proof capability and stability of the tent. Condensation was not an issue, even in these high humidity, cool night events. I am looking forward to seeing how the tent handles sub-freezing temperatures (with the weight of frozen water hanging onto the fly and not sheeting off). I would recommend the tent for anyone wanting added space at a reasonable weight (under 10 lbs packed weight).\n\n      \u2022 What Is Your Gear Style:\n      \u2022 Comfort Driven\n      \u2022 Was this a gift?:\n      \u2022 No\n\n      Displaying reviews 1-2\n\n      Back to top\n\n      Questions & Answers\n\n      Q & A For The Sierra Designs Yahi 4 Tall Tent - 4 Person, 3 Season\n\n      Warranty & Returns\n\n      Money Back Guarantee\n\n\n      Fit Guarantee\n\n\n      Extended Return Policy\n\n\n\n\n      Return an item\u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0More Return Policy Information\n\n      Sizing Chart\n\n      Sierra Designs sizing chart\n\n      About Sierra Designs\n\n      Sierra Designs\n      Other Ways to Shop:"}

These sacred spaces also provide an important connection both to the earth and to our past. Mount Olivet Cemetery, adjacent to a large thoroughfare in Salt Lake City, provides a space that is quiet and peaceful, allowing meditation in the middle of a bustling city. Here people are careful how they drive, talk, walk and act.\n\nBy far the most exciting and beautiful part of the cemetery are a series of individual family mausoleums; a neighborhood of small well-designed buildings nestled amongst rolling hills with abundant wildlife all around. Both times I visited the site, dozens of deer were present.\n\nYoung family mausoleum. Photo taken by author 07 Jun 2009.\n\nThese buildings with unknown designers deal with site placement, material selection, style, threshold, entry, security, and window and door openings, including stain glass windows. Many are approaching one hundred years old. In a way they act as precious jewel-box designs from a past era. Each of these family mausoleums were up to the family to design and build as they saw fit.\n\nL to R: Lewis and Bamberger family mausoleums.

Grant in 1874, Mount Olivet was established as a public burial place for all people at a reasonable cost. The entry gate on 500 South was designed by Walter Ware; the English Tudor office residence by Ware and Treganza; the red building to the south by Kletting, the architect of the Utah Capitol. More than 35,000 former citizens rest in the 50 developed acres of the cemetery. The Red Rock area is exclusively for cremains, though cremains can be interred in any plot. Eighty-eight varieties of trees shade paved roads that serve as strolling paths for nearby residents and for family and friends who come to reminisce.

Photo taken by author 09 Jun 2009.\n\nA colorful past lies buried at Mount Olivet\nS.L. Graveyard: Some of the state\u2019s richest and most powerful people are interred at the cemetery.\nMount Olivet Cemetery was founded in 1874, at a time when the territory\u2019s Mormons and non-Mormons clashed daily over questions of commerce, politics, polygamy and statehood. It\u2019s not that non-Mormons couldn\u2019t be buried in the Salt Lake City Cemetery. They could. But they wanted a place of their own.\n\nSo Episcopal Bishop Daniel S. Tuttle, with the help of the commander of Camp (now Fort) Douglas, petitioned Congress for 20 acres of the Army\u2019s land. Mount Olivet was Salt Lake City\u2019s second public burial ground and the only public non-profit cemetery in the United States ever to be created by an act of Congress. Bishop Tuttle named it after an academy he attended as a boy in the East.\n\nThe deed to Mount Olivet Cemetery came with some water rights to Red Butte and Emigration creeks, irrigation rights the trustees retain to this day. Those water rights were a source of pride in early times. The trustees of Mount Olivet reveled in the lush beauty of their park, especially because, located high on a hill, the Salt Lake Cemetery burned brown every summer.\n\nMount Olivet gained more land over the years. Now it has 88 acres. Half are developed; 31,000 people are interred here.\n\nSome of the state\u2019s richest and most powerful people are buried in Mount Olivet. Coleman likes to point out the graves of mining magnates Thomas Kearns and David Keith, the entrepreneur Walker brothers, bankers Russell Lord Tracy and James Collins, Gov. George H. Dern (who was also secretary of war under Franklin Roosevelt) and a number of Salt Lake mayors.\n\nUtah\u2019s Silver Queen, Susanna Bransford Emery, is buried somewhere in Mount Olivet. Coleman says that at the time of her burial there were so many rumors \u201cabout the silver dress she was buried in and silver dollars in her coffin\u201d that the exact location of her grave was kept secret. (Deseret News 5 Jun 1991)\n\nGreenhouse at Mt Olivet Cemetery. Photograph dated 1 Oct 1913. From Utah State Historical Society website.\n\nRemains of Greenhouse. Photo taken by author 09 Jun 2009.\n\nMount Olivet is a public, non-profit cemetery established by an Act of Congress that was signed by President U.S. Grant. The Salt Lake Mount Olivet was designed by three architects and known for its red sandstone and wrought iron-gates, office and barn. (Deseret News 25 May 1994)\n\nNotice the handsome office-residence just within the decorative iron gates at the main entrance. This building replaced an earlier wooden shack that served as the sexton's headquarters. A Mrs. Hall of the congregational Church donated funding for the Tudor design by Ware and Treganza, constructed in 1911. Recently the shielding overgrown pines were removed from the front yard, and the exterior of the building restored to its original color scheme and beauty. Beside it is the spacious dark red brick carriage house, added in 1913. Under its gabled roof the hay vas stored for the horses below, and multiple vehicles of the day. Today, all the horses, 380 of them, are under the hood of the tractor that serves so many functions.\n\nThe adjacent greenhouse no longer serves its original purpose. When there was a permanent staff of ten or more, it was possible to maintain extensive flower beds with their own stock from the greenhouse. Now with a reduced staff, down to six, with extras in the busy seasons, the present group is hard pressed to keep up with the chores of the much extended area presently in use.\n\nSome crypts are still in active use (Bamberger and Snyder) but since they take extra funds for maintenance, they are not as popular as they once were. Each structure can house one to thirteen caskets on the shelves within. (Floralie K. Millsaps, August 1988, A TOUR OF MOUNT OLIVET: The Cemetery Comes to Life)\n\nEntry gate designed by Ware & Treganza. Photo taken by author 09 Jun 2009.\n\n\n\n  1. this is very cool. I haven't explored Mt. Olivet because I would have to get in my car and drive there, and I'm already within walking distance of the cemetery in the Avenues. But I will make a point of visiting Mt. Olivet soon.\n\n  2. Holly - It must be great to be in walking distance of a cemetery - very peaceful places. There are actually some nice mausoleums in the jewish portion of the city cemetery that are more recent and modern in style, but also quite nice. And the entrance gate at the SW corner of city cemetery is stunning.\n\n  3. should have told you this ages ago, but back in September I visited this cemetery on your recommendation. I like that is has running water, and a few spots that welcome visitors to meditate, and I like some of the larger structures, but I admit I still prefer the cemetery in the Avenues: it's bigger, with more history, and better views.\n\n    it's also interesting to walk in the Avenues cemetery now that winter has arrived. It's noticeably colder there than in the streets surrounding it. I figure if cars and houses with active furnaces can make that much difference in the temperature of an individual neighborhood, there's not much point in arguing that human activity isn't affecting, quite negatively and intensely, the temperature of the planet overall.\n\n  4. I was not prepared for what I was to see when I visited the final place of an old friend. I expected a place with head stones, beautiful grave sites. Instead I find hundreds of flat markers flush with the ground just so the city can mow the grounds easily. The plates are hard to find, tell little about the person and in all practical since is a paupers grave sites. Devoid of color just large open fields with head stones flush to the ground. I was saddened to think a friend could be put in such a place, even state military cem. Are better kept. If all you want is a hole to place your love oe, then by all means put them here, otherwise cremate them would be better. But if you love them, love their memory then find a better place.\n\n  5. It just goes to show that when you see something frequently you forget to appreciate it. My parents, and many others of my ancestors, are buried at Mt. Olivet. Since my family lived on the Avenues of Salt Lake, my parents would have preferred to be buried in the City Cemetery (it was only two blocks away from our house). But now that I know more about what a special cemetery Mt. Olivet is, I'm very pleased to know that that is their final resting place. And we love going to see the deer there. They are a welcome addition to a beautifully kept graveyard.\n\n  6. i loved the huge wonderful blooming tres and weeping willows towering thn weeping to the ground. and the wonderful victorian statues! and the sweet gentle deer...what a restful meditative place to visit and be at rest in. i was glad to get to walk thru this park this Friedhof (peace court) i have some beautiful pics to remind me of my visit."}

I have also started feeling uncomfortable having him around at home. I do not like the way he looks at me. The other day, I accompanied him to a mall in Malad. We bumped into his office colleague who thought that I was his girlfriend. He kept laughing and did not even tell the guy that I was his cousin. After this incident, he has been acting funny with me. He hums some silly romantic numbers when I am around, but I choose to ignore him. Worse is when we have our evening meals together. I have to put on a facade in front of my father. I do not want him in the house. How do I tell my father without sounding offensive? My mother says she can't tell him as his parents will get upset.\n\u2014 Ayesha\n\n\nDear Ayesha,\nHe knows that you feel he is nuisance value, so he is purposely irritating you. He also knows that your dad will not say anything that offends him as he is his elder brother's son. Your mom feels if she chides him, it will blow out of proportion and become a family issue. But at the same time you need to have a chat with your dad. Explain to him your predicament and the mall incident. As it is a family member, things will have to be done with tact so that your uncle does not get offended. He might be just teasing you, but if you do not like it, he needs to stop. This needs to be told to him. It is better that your dad speak to him. Your father can also help him find a place so that he can move out faster. If it takes him a while to find a suitable place of his own, you will have to be patient till then.\n\nDiana will solve it!\n\nYou May Like\n\n\n\n    Leave a Reply"}
{"dataman_score": 4.0, "text": "August 2010 | Commentary | EcoDev\n\nIt\u2019s Time to Implement Cross-Border Trucking\n\nTags: Trucking, Cross-border Trade, Mexico\n\nKyle Burns is president and CEO of Free Trade Alliance, 210-229-9036.\n\nWhen the United States signed the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which included a commitment to open our roads to Mexico\u2019s cargo trucks, we were paving the way for economic opportunity, job growth, and prosperous foreign investment. Unfortunately, the United States has never fully complied with NAFTA\u2019s cross-border trucking program, costing our country billions and presenting a serious roadblock to economic recovery and prosperity.\n\nImplementing the trucking program will directly and immediately benefit U.S. exporters, business owners, workers, and consumers.\n\nThe history of NAFTA\u2019s trucking program is one of mixed messages and missed opportunities. Though the agreement entitles Mexican trucks to enter the United States to deliver cargo, we have only allowed access during a brief cross-border demonstration project. Installed after the United States was found to be in violation of NAFTA, the project allowed a select number of trucks to travel U.S. highways. While not technically fulfilling the agreement, it soothed tensions until last year, when Congress canceled the project and reinstated the ban.\n\nConsequences came quickly. Mexico immediately imposed tariffs on 90 U.S. products. Tariffs now exceed $2.4 billion and have resulted in the loss of 25,000 U.S. jobs, as U.S. goods have become less competitive in the Mexican market.\n\nAdherence to our current policy allows foreign competitors to take U.S. market share in Mexico, which we may never recover. Laborious cargo border transfers have also raised consumer prices. If the trucking program is reinstated, tariffs and transfer fees would be eliminated, spurring export activity and economic growth, creating new and higher-paying jobs, and reducing prices.\n\nfacing the consequences\n\nAs damaging as tariffs are, worse consequences may be in store. Violating our agreements creates distrust and jeopardizes trade opportunities, globally and with Mexico, our second-largest buyer of exports. U.S.-Mexico trade quadrupled under NAFTA, with trucks carrying 75 percent of goods. Maintaining strong, open relations is imperative \u2013 but unlikely without reinstating the cross-border trucking program.\n\nTo add insult to injury, we\u2019ve imposed no Canadian counterpart to the cross-border ban, which many in Mexico could perceive as prejudice. While critics cite safety concerns, statistics and proven safety measures further expose these arguments as a red herring.\n\nWhen it comes to safety, Mexico may have more cause for concern than the United States. As part of the demonstration project, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration inspected 5,000 long-haul Mexican trucks. Only 9.2 percent were placed out of service, compared to a 22-percent out-of-service rate for U.S. trucks. Nonetheless, Mexico has continued to allow our trucks on its roads.\n\nTo date, no accidents in the United States involved Mexican carriers. Support of the cross-border trucking program, and a desire to keep America safe, are not at odds. Inspections and other measures continue to maintain the highest safety standards.\n\nThe Obama Administration is reportedly devising a plan to address the trucking dispute, and U.S. business advocates are working to ensure progress, but more voices are needed. Contact your Congressional representatives and ask them to reinstate a trucking plan that satisfies NAFTA and addresses safety."}

{"dataman_score": 3.0, "text": "The hopeful continent\n\nAfrica rising\n\n\nSee article\n\nReaders' comments\n\n\n\nSome of the world's sharpest companies have noted. Siemens, Samsung and ABB all have big new Africa plans. Notably, absent are companies that are big on social PR ... shame on Apple, Facebook and Google...\n\n\nAfrica is perhaps the last piece in the puzzle of earth and perhaps, a better future. An astronomical amount of time and money has gone to help the citizens of Africa and especially its poorer regions, however, a clear growth in economy or development has never been seen. Their development would mean a better trade system, better education, health, chance for occupation and the many other things that go together with that. However, Africa becoming even close to a global power, is in a far and distant future. Asia took several decades to reach a stage of sustainability. At least another century would be in store and everything going perfectly, for Africa to have a promising existence.\n\n\nI am reading \"the man's other war\" from Sam Childers. I strongly recommend to read it to have a better idea of what is going on right now in Africa, specifically in Sudan and Uganda: poverty, corruption, slaughter and killing of villages and children who are raped and abducted to become cheap soldiers for an evil guy named Koni who wants everybody becomes islamist. Sam Childers is fighting against Koni. \"Africa rising\" brought my attention to read and I think there is always hope everywhere but we have to have the picture clear in order to come up with our own support. Historically there has always been unequal development. We have poor and rich people everywhere. In America, Latin America, Europe, Asia and Africa.\n\nWhat we have to fight for is for abusive unequal development. When we see that certain people or group of people take advantage of their position to always be in the top not taking care of or abusing the ones who do not have the power or education, then we have to raise our voice and let know that we are watching that corruption and has to stop. Whatever we do to stop it is a matter of wisdom following the same principle of not abusing of the less fortunate ones.\n\nYesterday I saw in TV that certain financial groups very well known (Allianze, Europe Funds ..) are investing in stocks related with food and that their decisions are affecting the provision and even death of people. That is the type of abuse I am talking about. Do not get me wrong. I am not communist. I am aware of horrible events under Stalin or \"communist\" goverments that restrain the free expresion.\n\nThe Market itself is not the solution. Any organization or system could be evil if only focus in their own development, ignoring and even mistreating others.\n\n\nAfrica is rising from the depths of the bottomless sea!! As the rest of the world is plummeting into recession and economies are breaking, Africa is using all its resources to grow its economy by ~ 6%. Even though Africa is still very poor in general, it is making a comeback where it is selling a ton of merchandise and food to any buyer that comes along. The industry in Africa is accelerating because millions of buyers are going to Africa to build businesses and spend money. I would laugh if Africa ever became as powerful as Asia and India have become. I feel like they have the potential but there are too many obstacles in their way for big improvements to take place.\n\n\nSimply giving \"handouts\" to African countries doesn't help their economy or long-term position, but in life or death situations this aid is needed. But it's promising to see the growth and opening of business in certain countries in Africa.\n\nInstability, corruption, and the government have been the biggest barriers to African countries reducing their poverty rates and/or protecting their people. Though the continent has the people and resources to support the economy, for many Africans survival is a better term than growth. The issues Africa faces in terms of becoming stable, over-population, and decreasing AIDS/HIV rates and orphans goes beyond the number of people with cell phones or business deals in the region. Huge social changes and supportive governments will have to come into play before Africa can become a \"world power\".\n\n\nThis was a very enlightening article because this is the first I've heard about Africa growing. I thought Africans were most all extremely poor and had very limited education. I thought their AIDS/HIV numbers were only rising steadily, I didn't know they were starting to decrease. I definitely didn't expect to find that they have so many more mobile users than the U.S. and Britain, but I guess that just shows how easily accessible technology has become for everyone. It is crazy to think that even a country like Africa, that's so underdeveloped and has had so many horrible leaders and tribal wars going on in recent years, is growing and globalizing too.\n\nThe article describes different countries as either under-developed or politically corrupt. They talk as if to suggest that western nations could influence the political development in these rising nations in a positive way to prevent corruption. However, it's hard to read the news on any given day in America without reading about some sort of corruption in our own government. The article also talks about how this continent is growing and how almost all of them had to go through reform and change through violence. Again, this sounds a lot like western nations (American Revolution). I don't believe any of the African nations are \"revolutionizing\" any worse than the developed nations already have. I do think, however, that the largest difference lies in the fact that there are other developed nations already in tact as they develop. These developed nations have already began taking advantage of some of the natural resources available in many of the African countries while covering it up with humanitarian efforts. Basically, we give them food and water and in return we deprive them (and cheat them) of their unknown natural resources such as their rare earth metals. An example can be found in Sierra Leone. China has many of the rights over the rare earth metals in this country. They have built up mining towns and imposed Chinese culture onto many of the cities and towns. In return, Sierra Leone gets a national soccer field built and funded by China. Fair trade? I think that if there was anything that would stifle the undeveloped, African growth it would be the greed of the developed and developing nations.\n\n\nOne day Britain will recognize that most African troubles have their origin in British royalty and their map makers.\n\n\nIt's good to see that other people are beginning to notice the hope and potential in africa. Not only do they still need alot of reform and stronger government tax breaks, but what they really need is an improvement in their infrastructure. They have alot of resources and potential, but that potential can not be reached until they have the road and transit system to carry the goods.\n\nGianni Conti\n\nNot good. Asia is following in the footsteps of the West, which is floundering. The world's development, however, is now in hypertrophy. Do we really need to learn this lesson the hard way, like a stubborn child that requires many beatings to finally start listening?\n\nThe constant growth model doesn't work. Do we have to exhaust all the Earth's resources before realizing that?\n\n\n\"In eight of the past ten years, Africa has grown faster than East Asia, including Japan.\"\n\nThis is the most unintelligent statement I ever read in TE.\n\n\nAfrica seems to be in a similar boat that many Asian countries were in dating back to not even half of a century ago. Asian countries like China, Japan and South Korea were in a fit of war (some with external powers and some civil), corruption and poverty. If you told anyone in the 1960s that these three countries would be some of the most prosperous economies in the world in 2011, they most likely would have laughed in your face. The fact of the matter is that with a stable, uncorrupted government and hard work and determination by their people, these three countries are booming while most of the world, especially the western world, is in a recession.\n\nI can see Africa heading toward the same path as these Asian countries. Once civil wars settle and countries in this region start setting up stable, uncorrupted governments, African economies could see the same unbelievably quick growth as China, Japan and South Korea. These people will most likely feel worthless and ashamed of the decades of senseless violence and corruption that took part within their homes, and will want to make a solid reputation for Africans as a whole. This motivation leads me to believe that quite a few African countries will become world leaders with some of the top economies in the world at some point during my lifetime.\n\n\nAlthough I truly believe there are countries in Africa that are slowly but surely growing in the right direction, it is difficult for me to comprehend that Africa may someday reach an economic status such as Asia's. The poverty, corruption, and turmoil that engulfs the continent is no where near done. Nevertheless, as the world has grown more globalized, people are looking from the outside in and taking a stand to make a difference in Africa. For this reason, I believe there is still hope for a new and better future for the people of the region but the will must come from inside then out. The people must want the change, and aid must be given due to the oppression that leaves them hopeless. Maybe then, after much effort to wipe out corruption and establish stability, can Africa then be compared to world powers within Asia.\n\nJoseph Tan in reply to BriHarb\n\nYou must be a bit positive. Do you know there are lots of higher education students from Africa like Namibia and Kenya studying in Malaysia, not mentioning other countries in Asia like China?\nfrom my little interaction with them, it seems to me that they are just like us, brilliant, smart, have a very definitive sense of purpose and have a very open-mind. If Africans are allowed to interact much with Asia, I do not see why in Africa cannot match the economic status considering African had abundance resources.\n\nAfter all, not too a distance past, Brazil was also a basket-case. Today she is poised to be the 5th largest economy in the world!\n\n\nConnect-the-dots made a comment on this article which merits the readers attention. In brief I think that self-independence is a lesson that Africa can learn from China given the right formula for political and economic reforms which should deny corrupted and violent elements/groups any access to foreign Aid or governance. It takes more than African minds and hearts to do it. I think that America and Europe may be able to help Africans if the good will exists.\n\n\nThis article is a little decieving in how optimistic the author is about the African economy as a whole. Africa has huge numbers of resources from farming to minerals Africa has the potential to be the bread-basket of the world. They have a long way to go though. Many nations are ruled by dictatorships and warlords who have no interest in bettering their state or peoples. The second problem hindering Africa is its lack of unity. There are still thousands of tribes in Africa and until a government can create unity within its people it would be difficult to really develop as a country. Thirdly, as mentioned in this article, the infrastructure of Africa is dismal. Roadways largely consist of mud. If you are going to build a strong country or continent, you need roadways that people can travel quickly on to transfer products from one place to another. Africa is growing, but until these three problems are faced, it will continue to struggle as a continent.\n\nuntapped99 in reply to iandusci\n\nWith due respect, but I would like to hear more clarification on some of your statements.\n1. Warlords? Who are they? what countries are they running?\n2. You are talking about the need to create more unity in order to develop Africa as a country. Africa comprises 54 different countries with different dynamics. Why on earth do you want them to be run as a single country?\n\nConnect The Dots\n\nThe West's Economy is failing. Should the West be dictating the Path of Africa?\n\nInstead of a new conference, summit, initiatives and unfunded programs, how about a simple policy of Laissez Faire. Let the Market Work. This is the success of the Chinese example.\n\nLet Africa fail--which is the status quo despite Trillions in intervention and western expertise in the past 50 years.\n\nOR let Africa succeed with its own initiative, hard work and self interest. Nothing is worse than the policies of the past 50 years.\n\nTo get out of a hole, the first step is to stop digging. Realize a fail policy when you see one. Take a different path.\n\nLet the African compete on the market by selling their products and resources. This is the Chinese policy and it may replicate the success of Asia.\n\nI am a Chinese,but I don't think Africa should learn from China.Africa is a very diversified continent! differnt africa countries have diffrent challenges,To a certain extent,africa is only a geographical concept.\n\nIndia is a befitting example for Africa to compare.Basically China has a very long hisory as an unified country(since BC 220),and at least,95% population share a common culture and language and race etc.\n\nErry in reply to silent night\n\nI agree it's absurd to compare Africa, a continent, to China. I also don't think India is a good comparison either. Africa is Africa and its development will be uniquely fitted to each individual nation. Some nations will shine and others not so much. Nigeria, if it can resolve its power issue over the decade, will rise to become a major emerging economy. Others such as DR Congo have the potential, but the nation has serious issues to resolve, and is one of the least developed on the continent, in order to end its long slumber.\n\nSir Pumpkin Longshanks\n\nAfrica has a lot ahead of them if middle class means making $3,000 a year. If African governments were rid of their corruption Africa will be the next India. They are very similar if you compare Africa with India a couple decades ago: huge population, mostly poverty. It would be interesting to see a graph comparing unemployment, growth, population, salaries, demographics, industries, etc. in Africa today and India when it was at around the same point.\n\n\nFrom the \"Hopeless Continent\" to the hopeful, must have been all the heat you got from that incredibly callous title you ran a few years ago.\n\nMtu Flani in reply to DiogenesClub\n\nHaha! I remember that article very, very well. Talk about swallowing your own words! Whats more, it's only just beginning! Our countless centuries of suffering will soon give birth to countless centuries of peace and prosperity.\n\n\nThis article changed the way I look at Africa completely. I think of Africa as a giant poor safari. Yes, that is a pretty pathetic image, but Africa is often reflected as a poor, dry, and starving country. It blew my mind when I read about the number of mobile phones. More than America? That seems extremely impressive to me. The number of entrepreneurs also impressed me. I had no idea Africa was growing in this way, and I am glad. Africa has a lot of potential, and its good they are finally chasing after it!\n\n\"Africa is often reflected as a poor, dry and starving country.\" Africa is a CONTINENT! although I do not blame you for thinking otherwise because the adverts on TV of \"poor African children\" promote the idea of Africa being a country and that the whole of Africa is poor when in reality, not EVERYONE in Africa is broke. the middle class, in a lot of ways, have a better quality of life than the middle class in overseas countries. I know this because I have lived in America, UK and Africa.\n\n\nLatest blog posts - All times are GMT\nWorld Cup predictions: Scoring ourselves\nGraphic detail 1 mins ago\nCar technology: Turbocharged\nSchumpeter July 12th, 9:00\nGun laws: Prayers and pistols\nDemocracy in America July 11th, 17:43\nDaily chart: Justice on trial\nGraphic detail July 11th, 13:40\n\n\nProducts and events\n\n\n\n"}

Courtesy: OpEd News, July 28, 2012\n\n\u00a0 Batman: The Dark Knight by comicbooked.com\n\n\n\n\nBut I'd like to focus a bit on a message that might have escaped most fans, Batman vs. Occupy.\n\nTo recap the relevant part of the story: The movie starts with Gotham City cleaned free of gangs by virtue of the late Attorney General Harvey Dent's law -- a law that brings the hammer down on organized crime, crushing it, perhaps at the cost of liberty, but certainly at the cost of truth -- for Harvey Dent was the violently schizoid villain of the last Batman film, whom Batman killed but then allowed to be lionized in order that a cult of personality would allow Dent's signature law to be carried out. \u00a0\n\n\nBane encourages the \"People\" to take back their wealth from the 1%, to govern themselves, basically everyman for himself, with a former Batman nemesis, Scarecrow, running a Kangaroo court that is so corrupt it doesn't even bother with trials, just sentencing: Die or face Exile - which turns out to be basically the same thing as it entails walking out onto the East River's (the set city is actually New York -- Hollywood's favorite city to blow up) thin ice. \u00a0 Only the Fat Cats, the resisting police, and other \"enemies of the people\" are set out on the ice.\n\nNow, Bane has a secret plan to let the unstable bomb count down to zero and finally blow up Gotham -- including himself and his gang -- eventually, but the public is unaware, or disbelieving of this for months, while an injured and defeated Batman languishes in the near-literal hellhole in some forgotten part of the Middle East world where Bane was originally imprisoned before his escape. \u00a0\u00a0 So, effectively, Hollywood is showing the nightmare version of a post-Occupy anarchy, initially brought about by a powerful warlord, who then goes on to leave the people pretty much to fend for themselves, only intervening when it seems like the police who remain loyal to Commissioner Gordon (Batman's friend and supporter) in trying to restore order (the political faction has long since been disposed of at this point in the film). \u00a0\n\n\nThe prisons are opened, supposedly, says Bane, to \"free the oppressed.\" \u00a0 All institutions start to break down, and Washington remains paralyzed, afraid to intervene because if they do, or if just one Gotham citizen crosses out of the city on the few remaining bridges, the rest will be annihilated. \u00a0\n\n\nThis is the choice the Batman (respectful fans talk of the Batman, not just Batman as if it were just a single name, like Fabio) gives us. \u00a0 Corruption, constantly held in check by a few do-gooders like most of the police, some of the politicians, but mostly Batman, though based on a lie (Harvey Dent's goodness). \u00a0 Batman, aptly subheaded: \"The Dark Knight Rises\" shows us that it's fine to battle against evil, one villain at a time, but don't try to change the basic system overall, or you will wind up with an uncontrollable mob, rule by violence, and a crumbling society that will eventually self-destruct -- even if a bomb doesn't destroy it first. \u00a0 Batman then, is the vigilante protecting the people from themselves. \u00a0 The Dark Knight who fights for our freedom because if we really had it, we take it away from ourselves. \u00a0 He can be trusted because he is so profoundly anguished from the death of his own parents at the hands of an (anarchistic) gunman. \u00a0 He knows firsthand what chaos brings, and so he will ironically preserve freedom by preserving the status quo, only cleaned piece by piece, of its corruption and evil, while leaving the corruption and evil breeding system relatively unscathed. \u00a0 This message is further driven home when Bruce Wayne, Batman's civilian alter-ego, perhaps his civilian SUPER-ego, spends the 7 years between the adventures of the last film, and this one, building a pollution-free energy source for the world\"only to suppress it in a cavern that he can flood at the touch of a button should anyone actually threaten to take it form Wayne Industries. \u00a0 In the movie, Wayne's fears are proved prescient, because the core of the device does in fact, become the source of the atomic bomb Bane holds the city hostage with. \u00a0 See, the people cannot be trusted! \u00a0 They are not ready for free unlimited energy! \u00a0 Fortunately, Batman will save us, and Bruce Wayne will out-think us. \u00a0 No wonder he is a Dark Knight, not a White Knight. \u00a0 The paradox is that Batman must save us from killing ourselves -- an elite fighting the mob, while bringing down selective members of the elite when they stray off-course too much (like the financiers who originally fund Bane, before he turns on them too, as all anarchists must turn on their employers, eventually).\n\n\n\nHe is President of Common Ground-NYC (http://commongroundnyc.org/), a Geoist group focusing on achieving social justice and economic growth by untaxing (more...)\n\n\n\n\nPost new comment\n"}

The company, which was registered with the ATF as a federal firearms dealer, claimed it was simply storing the guns owned by the Camden County Sheriff's Office, which had only a handful of deputies.\n\nThe company was limited by its federal firearms license in how many automatic weapons it could legally own. But law enforcement agencies are not. Blackwater contracted a sheriff's department employee as a \"weapons custodian\" at the company's compound, where the assault rifles were routinely used in training exercises with Blackwater's clients. Prosecutors said the arrangement was intended to subvert the federal restrictions on how many automatic weapons could be at the company's facility.\n\nSeveral of the federal charges were related to a Bushmaster M4 rifle, three Glock handguns and a Remington shotgun presented to King Abdullah and his traveling entourage during a 2005 visit to Blackwater's headquarters. Prosecutors said the weapons were part of a bid for Blackwater to land a lucrative security contract with Jordan and that registration records tracking the guns were later falsified to claim the weapons were sold to individuals.\n\nThough many documents in the court file are still under seal for national security reasons, it appears the government's case began to unravel last year when defense lawyers produced sworn statements from two retired CIA officials who said they knew about the weapons presented to the king.\n\n\n\"I have information related to the transfer of firearms to the King of Jordan described in numerous counts of the indictment and how the U.S. government's authorization for the transfer of those weapons took place,\" Maguire said in a statement filed with the court.\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo of the Blackwater employees' charred bodies were photographed hanging from a bridge while a crowd of Iraqis that included children cheered, producing one of the most indelible and disturbing images of the war.\n\n\nFollow Associated Press writer Michael Biesecker at twitter.com/mbieseck"}

{"dataman_score": 4.0, "text": "Home Learn English Teach English MyEnglishClub\nEnglish Club : Learn English : Vocabulary : Sports : Athletics Vocabulary\n\n\nVocabulary | Knowledge Quiz | Vocabulary Quiz\n\nMany people have memories of competing in athletics, or \"track and field\", in school. Some competed in running events, such as sprints and longer-distance races, or jumping events, such as high jump and long jump, or throwing events, such as discus and shot put. While most people give up athletics after leaving school, a few go on to become professional athletes who compete in top meetings around the world. Many people enjoy watching these highly-skilled, super-fit athletes when they compete in major competitions such as the IAAF World Championships in Athletics and the Olympic Games.\n\n\nAs long ago as the 8th century B.C., athletics events were being held as part of the original Olympic Games in ancient Greece. Some of the events from that time, such as javelin and discus throwing, are still part of modern athletics. In 19th-century England, athletics competitions were being held in military and public schools such as the Royal Military College in Sandhurst and Exeter College in Oxford. By the time of the first modern Olympic Games in 1896, the sport had developed to such an extent that \"track and field\" events were central to the competition. From then until now, athletics have formed the foundation of major sporting competitions such as the Commonwealth and Asian Games, as well as the Olympics. Since 1983, the World Championships in Athletics have also been boosting interest in the sport. This biennial competition is organized by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF), and is now seen as one of the top events in the world of sports, along with the Summer Olympics and the FIFA World Cup football tournament.\n\nHow Athletics Works\n\nModern athletics meetings are held at both outdoor and indoor venues. Outdoor meetings are usually held in summer and spring, with track events run on a 400 meter track with 8 lanes while the jumping and throwing events take place on the large open area inside the track. Indoor meetings are held in winter, with running events usually held on a 200 metre track and a limited range of field events held on the area inside the track.\n\nIn both indoor and outdoor competitions, men and women compete in their own events. While they usually run the same distances in track events, hurdles are lower for women. In field events, the weights of the shot, discus, javelin and hammer are less for women than for men.\n\nTrack Events\n\nTrack events include a wide range of races for runners. The shorter races are called sprints and they include 60 metre (indoors only), 100m, 200m and 400m. Middle-distance races are the 800m, 1500m, the mile, the 3,000m, and the steeplechase, in which runners have to jump over barriers and water jumps. Long distance events are the 5,000m and 1,0000m, along with athletics' longest race for runners, the marathon. Most of this 42.195 km race is run on public roads, with only the last part being run on an athletics track. Other track events are the hurdles, including the 110m high hurdles (100m for women) and 400m hurdles, and the relay events, the most common of which are the 4 x 100m relay and the 4 x 400m relay. In the relay races, runners carry a baton and pass it to the next runner as they finish their part of the race.\n\nField Events\n\nField events include jumping events and throwing events. The jumping events are the high jump, long jump, triple jump and pole-vault. The throwing events are the shot put, in which a heavy metal ball (called the shot) is thrown as far as possible; the hammer throw, in which a heavy metal ball attached to a wire and handle is thrown; the javelin, in which a spear-like object made of metal or fiberglass is thrown; and the discus, in which a heavy disc is thrown.\n\n\nThere are a number of athletics competitions regularly held around the world for professional athletes. The biggest of these is the World Championships, held every two years by the IAAF. There are also several regional competitions, such as the European Championships, the Pan-American Games, and the Commonwealth Games. In addition, there is the Golden League circuit in which athletes who win their chosen event at all six meetings share a $1,000,000 jackpot. This competition is attracting more and more interest among sports fans, but the high point of interest in athletics still occurs every four years when the track and field events of the Summer Olympics are held. Billions of enthusiastic viewers around the world watch TV broadcasts of these events as they follow the fortunes of their country's top athletes.\n\nFamous Athletes\n\nPaavo Nurmi\n\nPaavo Nurmi was born in Finland in 1897, and grew up to become one of the world's greatest middle-distance and long-distance runners. He still holds the record for having won the greatest number of Olympic track and field medals, with 12 medals in all. These include 9 gold medals which he won in the 1,500m, 5,000m, 10,000m, cross country, cross country team and the 3,000m team races. Due to this fact he is often regarded as the greatest track and field athlete of all time. Known as the \"Flying Finn\", he is probably also the only athlete to have had a heavenly body named after him. In 1939, Finnish astronomer Yrj\u00f6 V\u00e4is\u00e4l\u00e4 named an asteroid after him, calling it 1740 Paavo Nurmi.\n\nCarl Lewis\n\nCarl LewisCarl Lewis, regarded by many as the greatest competitor of all time in athletics, was named the world male athlete of the 20th Century by the IAAF. Born in 1961 in the U.S.A., he became a champion sprinter and long jumper who, like Paavo Nurmi, won 9 Olympic gold medals. Lewis won the gold medal for the long jump in the 1984, 1988, 1992 and 1996 Olympic Games. He also won gold medals in 1984 and 1988 in the 100 metres sprint and a gold medal for the 200 metres in 1984, as well as a silver medal for the same event in 1988. His two other Olympic gold medals were won in 1984 and 1992 in the 4 x 100 metre relay races. British Formula 1 racing driver Lewis Hamilton was named after Carl Lewis because Hamilton's father was a huge fan of the great American athlete. (Carl Lewis, above, is on the right wearing number 1102.)\n\nAthletics Vocabulary\n\nWordExample sentenceMeaning\nathletePaavo Nurmi and Carl Lewis are two of the greatest athletes of all time.a person who is skilled in track and field events;

Now that it\u2019s here, can it continue to make a buck off it?\n\nQualcomm holds key patents for the technologies used in so-called 3G wireless networks, thanks to the fact Qualcomm cooked up the code-division multiple access technology at the heart of many high-speed wireless networks.\n\nVideo: Nokia\u2019s Hot Applications\n\nThe result is Qualcomm can reap rich royalties from handsets that don\u2019t include a single Qualcomm part. And with 3G handsets such as Apple\u2018s iPhone 3G tearing up the sales charts, it\u2019s little wonder Qualcomm\u2019s shares are up $5.93, or 15.07%, to $45.28 from $39.35 a year ago.\n\nThe problem: Qualcomm is shelling out big bucks for complex, and costly, court fights involving the intellectual property at the heart of the latest wireless gizmos. A new round will begin Wednesday when it squares off with Nokia \u2013the world\u2019s largest handset vendor\u2013over how much the Finnish company owes Qualcomm in royalties after a licensing deal between the two companies expired in April of last year.\n\nPartly as a result of the legal fights with Nokia and rival chip maker Broadcom , analysts worry that Qualcomm\u2019s earnings last quarter may have sagged as much as 6% over the same period a year ago. The final results will be out on Wednesday afternoon, when Qualcomm releases its numbers after the close of trading. Analysts predict that Qualcomm will show net income of $877.5 million, or 54 cents per share, on sales of $2.7 billion. By contrast, it had profits of $934 million, or 47 cents per share, on sales of $2.3 billion a year ago at this time.\n\nSee Also\n\nTexas Instruments Trips Up On Wireless Chips\n\nQualcomm Licked In Legal Battle\n\nCarriers Outline Wireless Future\n\nComments are turned off for this post."}
